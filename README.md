Thank you for installing Nitrocid KS on your system! This application is designed to simulate our future-planned kernel in managed code! Yes, our crafted kernel is made with our imagination and our art of kernel design!

This is not only a kernel simulator by itself which simulates hardware info fetching and booting, but it is also a bootable application. Wait! Are you trying to put it to your GRUB boot entry or your Windows BCD entry? Well, it's currently impossible to do! Because it's made in C#. Fortunately, we've made a bootloader simulator, GRILO, to simulate how GRUB boots into Linux by booting into any .NET application.

This kernel that is being simulated is planned for our future kernel made for personal and enterprise PCs and servers. It'll try to compete with existing monolithic kernels, such as Windows NT Kernel and Unix kernels.
