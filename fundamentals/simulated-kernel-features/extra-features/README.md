# ðŸŒŸ Extra Features

In addition to the base kernel features that are highlighted in the list of simulated kernel features after this master page, the kernel also provides extra features if their associated addons are installed to the kernel.

Select a page below to go to a feature:

{% content-ref url="more-networking/" %}
[more-networking](more-networking/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="games-and-amusements/" %}
[games-and-amusements](games-and-amusements/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="common-programs/" %}
[common-programs](common-programs/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="chatgpt-client.md" %}
[chatgpt-client.md](chatgpt-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## How do I get these programs?

You can get these extra features, including extra languages, splashes, and screensavers, by either downloading the addons ZIP file from the releases page of the Nitrocid project at GitHub, or by using the `getaddons` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's necessary to reboot the kernel for the addons to get loaded.
{% endhint %}
