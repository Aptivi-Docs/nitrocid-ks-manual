StreetRun simulates a car that tries to escape traffic while going faster during the street run. Combined with traffic that either runs very slowly or very quickly, the game becomes more challenging. If you crash, the game is over.

### Controls

* `Left Arrow` to move the car left
* `Right Arrow` to move the car right
* `ESC` to exit
