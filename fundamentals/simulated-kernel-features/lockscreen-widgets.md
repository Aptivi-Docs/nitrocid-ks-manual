# ðŸ“… Lockscreen Widgets

Lockscreen widgets is a modern lockscreen feature that gives you quick insights about different information, including the world clock and the news, in a full-screen format. These widgets can be found in the modern logon screen introduced in the 0.1.0 version of Nitrocid. In the lock screen, you can easily switch between the main screen and the widgets (up to 2 widgets).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Lockscreen widgets are not supported in the classic lock screen style. For custom lock screens, you'll need to handle the widget display yourself.

## Setting widgets

This feature is unfinished. This section will be filled in once we finish implementing it.

## Configuring widgets

You can configure the widgets using the settings application by executing the `settings` command, passing it the `-widgets` switch. Select a widget using the up/down arrow keys, then use the tab key to change the focus to the widget settings entry list. You can use the enter key afterwards to customize the widgets.
