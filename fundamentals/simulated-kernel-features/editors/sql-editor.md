The SQL Shell allows you to execute any SQL command to a connected database file. It supports databases which are created by SQLite, MySQL, and their derivatives.

{% hint style="info" %}
For list of commands supported by MySQL, consult this [link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html).
{% endhint %}

You can execute any SQL command using the `cmd` command, and you can get database information using the `dbinfo` command.
