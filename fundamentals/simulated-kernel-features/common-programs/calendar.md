# ðŸ—“ Calendar

{% hint style="info" %}
Nitrocid KS provides this feature as an addon.
{% endhint %}

The calendar shows you days, weeks, and months within the selected year. It not only shows how many days in a month, but it also shows the weekends in a special color or formatting and the business days in the normal color. A calendar can handle events in either a single day or within a day range. Modern calendars get synced with the latest holidays in your country.

The simulated kernel provides you with the calendar management application that attempts to simulate the above functionality. Choose a function to get started. In summary, these usages are found within the `calendar` command.

* `calendar <show> [year] [month]`
* `calendar <event> <add> <date> <title>`
* `calendar <event> <remove> <eventid>`
* `calendar <event> <list>`
* `calendar <event> <saveall>`
* `calendar <reminder> <add> <dateandtime> <title>`
* `calendar <reminder> <remove> <reminderid>`
* `calendar <reminder> <list>`
* `calendar <reminder> <saveall>`

### Showing the Calendar

## Calendar management API

In addition to providing the calendar command in the addon, the base Nitrocid API provides some of the calendar management APIs to make access to them easier than before. You can now get the calendar straight from the calendar type using the `GetCalendar()` function from the `CalendarTools` class.

Additionally, the time and date renderers can be used with the base calendar class instance obtained from the above function.
