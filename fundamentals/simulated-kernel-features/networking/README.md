# üåç Networking

Networking in general allows your device to connect to other devices in either your local network ‚Äì that allows you to make a connection to other systems that are found in the same network ‚Äì and across the Internet ‚Äì that allows you to connect to all the other systems found world-wide ‚Äì to actually access resources found on these systems and, across the LAN, save time trying to go back and forth to the target system to pull and push data.

To simulate this functionality, the simulated kernel provides several features, including the basic networking tools like downloading and uploading files to the remote PCs. These functions can be invoked with built-in main commands.

### Download a file

To download a file from a computer or an Internet website, use the `get` command to download to your current working directory. Use the following execution method to download a URL: `get <URL>`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that this command currently doesn't support downloading a file to other file names in other directories.

This command also doesn't support downloading more than 2 GB.
{% endhint %}

### Upload a file

To upload a file to either a local computer or to an Internet URL, use the `put` command to do this action. Depending on the URL, you must have administrative privileges on the URL to be able to upload a file. Usage: `put <file> <URL>`.

## What else?

There are much more features related to networking than just uploading and downloading things. In fact, the kernel provides several of the shells which allow you to communicate with the computers using different protocols, like HTTP and SFTP, and use it for getting information, like the RSS client that actually works as a shell.

Select a shell below to get started.

{% content-ref url="ftp-client.md" %}
[ftp-client.md](ftp-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="sftp-client.md" %}
[sftp-client.md](sftp-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="http-client.md" %}
[http-client.md](http-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="rss-client.md" %}
[rss-client.md](rss-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="mail-client.md" %}
[mail-client.md](mail-client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Attaching and Detaching

Every single client listed above support attachment to existing connections and detachment from the current connection. When you use one of the clients for the first time, it lets you create a new connection. From there, you have to specify some info about which server you're going to connect, the username, and the password, depending on the client.

When you're connected to any server, you can detach the current connection, which causes you to go back to your shell when you're still connected. In order to attach back to your session, use the same command that you used to create a new connection to connect to the existing server or to create a second new connection.

To detach, simply use the `detach` command to go back to your shell.

#### Speed dial for networked shells

{% hint style="warning" %}
Speed dial for networked shells works only for FTP and SFTP shells in Beta 2, but we'll try to add full support in Beta 3.
{% endhint %}

Speed dial allows you to quickly connect to servers with your username, your address, your port, and your custom network configuration. This will save time in having to enter address information manually each time you connect to the same server.

When you invoke a command that launches your networked shell (FTP for example), a selection window shows up with the option to either select an established connection, an option to create a new connection manually, or connect to the saved networks using the speed dial functionality.
