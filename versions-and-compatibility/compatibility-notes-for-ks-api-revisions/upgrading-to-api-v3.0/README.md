# ðŸ”¼ Upgrading to API v3.0

As API v3.0 is still in development, the breaking changes get committed and land here. They describe what broke and what should be used instead.

{% hint style="danger" %}
.NET Framework 4.8 is **no longer supported** as of 0.1.0 Beta 1. Please consider using .NET 8.0 instead to continue using Nitrocid KS. This is to improve multi-platform support without having to go to one environment (`dotnetfx` on Windows and `mono` on Linux and macOS) for each platform.
{% endhint %}

## To 0.1.0

This version is a futuristic magic that brings in many feature additions and spectacular improvements in all fields, including cosmetic changes.

[v0.1.x.x-series](../../version-release-notes/v0.1.x.x-series/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Important notice**

A breaking change has been made so that every mod that need to work with API version `3.0.25.123` or higher should satisfy the following conditions for their versions:

* Mod versions should satisfy the SemVer v2.0 specification. Mod parsing will fail if an invalid version expression is entered.

Additionally, a breaking change has been made starting from API version `3.0.25.154` that will make the mod loader fail if:

* the mod is not strongly signed using any strong naming key and loading untrusted mods is disabled.

Starting from API version `3.0.25.310`, Nitrocid KS now uses .NET 8.0, which means that all your mods will have to be updated to continue working.
{% endhint %}

This will be populated as soon as we reach the release candidate stage of 0.1.0 to maintain consistency.
