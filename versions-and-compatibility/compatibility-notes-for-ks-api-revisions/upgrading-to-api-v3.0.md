# ðŸ”¼ Upgrading to API v3.0

As API v3.0 is still in development, the breaking changes get committed and land here. They describe what broke and what should be used instead.

{% hint style="danger" %}
.NET Framework 4.8 is **no longer supported** as of 0.1.0 Beta 1. Please consider using .NET 6.0 instead to continue using Nitrocid KS. This is to improve multi-platform support without having to go to one environment (`dotnetfx` on Windows and `mono` on Linux and macOS) for each platform.
{% endhint %}

## To 0.1.0

This version is a futuristic magic that brings in many feature additions and spectacular improvements in all fields, including cosmetic changes.

{% content-ref url="../version-release-notes/v0.1.x.x-series/" %}
[v0.1.x.x-series](../version-release-notes/v0.1.x.x-series/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Important notice**

**A breaking change has been made so that every mod that need to work with API version 3.0.25.123 or higher should satisfy the following conditions for their versions:**

* **Mod versions should satisfy the SemVer v2.0 specification. Mod parsing will fail if an invalid version expression is entered.**
{% endhint %}

### **Moved events to `KS.Kernel.Events`**

{% code title="Events.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Class Events
    Friend Property FiredEvents As New Dictionary(Of String, Object())

    'These events are fired by their Raise<EventName>() subs and are responded by their Respond<EventName>() subs.
    Public Event KernelStarted()
    Public Event PreLogin()
    Public Event PostLogin(Username As String)
(...)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="EventsManager.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function ListAllFiredEvents() As Dictionary(Of String, Object())
Public Function ListAllFiredEvents(SearchTerm As String) As Dictionary(Of String, Object())
Public Sub ClearAllFiredEvents()
```
{% endcode %}

All of the event-related code files are moved to `KS.Kernel.Events` to separate these from the actual kernel code. However, because events are part of the kernel, we prefer to put it on `KS.Kernel` namespace rather than `KS.Misc`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to kernel events from `KS.Misc` to `KS.Kernel.Events`.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `PlatformDetector` to `KS.Kernel.KernelPlatform`**

{% code title="PlatformDetector.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module PlatformDetector
```
{% endcode %}

It has come to the conclusion that `PlatformDetector` is now promoted to the Kernel namespace under the name `KernelPlatform` so you can access it under the `KS.Kernel` namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to kernel platform code from `KS.Misc` to `KS.Kernel.KernelPlatform`.
{% endhint %}

### **Separated the MOTD and MAL parsers**

{% code title="MOTDParse.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Enum MessageType As Integer
```
{% endcode %}

MOTD and MAL parsers were unified since early versions of Nitrocid KS. However, it didn't occur to us that we need to separate them for a very long time. We took actions to separate them, effectively removing the `MessageType` enumeration.

{% hint style="info" %}
* If you want to use the MOTD parser, use the `KS.Misc.Probers.Motd` namespace to use the `MotdParse` static class methods.
* However, if you want to use the MAL parser, use the `KS.Misc.Probers.Mal` namespace to use the `MalParse` static class methods.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `GetTerminal*` to `KernelPlatform`**

{% code title="ConsoleExtensions.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function GetTerminalEmulator() As String
Public Function GetTerminalType() As String
```
{% endcode %}

These two functions are actually part of the terminal, and they make use of the `$TERM_PROGRAM` and `$TERM` environment variables, which are dependent on the terminal.

Since these usually are undefined in Windows, we put these functions to `KernelPlatform` to accommodate the change as platform-dependent, but we don't actually check for Linux to execute these functions, because some terminal emulators in Windows actually define these variables.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to kernel terminal detection code from `KS.ConsoleBase` to `KS.Kernel.KernelPlatform`.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved shell common folders to `KS.Shell.Shells`**

This is to separate the shell code for each tool from their folders to a unified namespace, `KS.Shell.Shells`. It houses every shell for every tool. This is to make creation of built-in shells easier.

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that `*ShellCommon` modules are moved to `KS.Shell.Shells.*` and every call to that module should be redirected to that namespace. The tools, however, stays intact.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `MakePermanent()`**

{% code title="ColorTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub MakePermanent()
```
{% endcode %}

MakePermanent used to save all the colors to kernel configuration. This function was now removed as a result of recent configuration improvements.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### **Graduated `Configuration` to `KS.Kernel`**

{% code title="Config.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Namespace Misc.Configuration
```
{% endcode %}

This configuration logic was smart enough to be graduated, since it's the core function in the kernel. It's used everywhere, including the `settings` command, which is an application that lets you adjust settings on the go.

### **Graduated `FindSetting` and `CheckSettingsVariables`**

{% code title="SettingsApp.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function FindSetting(Pattern As String, SettingsToken As JToken) As List(Of String)
Public Function CheckSettingsVariables() As Dictionary(Of String, Boolean)
```
{% endcode %}

These two functions were unrelated to the settings app, but `FindSetting()` was what `KS.Misc.Settings.SettingsApp` uses, and `CheckSettingsVariables()` was renamed to `CheckConfigVariables()` to accommodate with the graduation.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find these methods in the `ConfigTools` module located in the `KS.Kernel.Configuration` namespace.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="ConfigTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static List<InputChoiceInfo> FindSetting(string Pattern, JToken SettingsToken)
public static Dictionary<string, bool> CheckConfigVariables()
```
{% endcode %}

### **Moved power management functions to `KS.Kernel.Power`**

These power management functions were there in `KernelTools` since the earliest version of KS. Now, they're relocated to `KS.Kernel.Power`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to kernel power code from `KS.Kernel.KernelTools` to `KS.Kernel.Power`.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `InitPaths` in favor of properties**

{% code title="Paths.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Sub InitPaths()
```
{% endcode %}

Now, we don't have to initialize paths every time we make an internal app that depends on Nitrocid KS's paths. The call to the function that gets the path, `GetKernelPath`, however won't be removed because it's widely used and is unaffected.

{% hint style="info" %}
This function is not part of the public API. Reflection calls to this function will stop working. We advice you to use the `GetKernelPath` function since it's much faster.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="Paths.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static string GetKernelPath(KernelPathType PathType)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Moved kernel update code to `Kernel.Updates`**

These power management functions were there in `KernelTools` since the earliest version of KS. Now, they're relocated to `KS.Kernel.Updates`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to kernel update code from `KS.Kernel.KernelTools` to `KS.Kernel.Updates`.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `ListArgs` from `ICommand` and `IArgument`**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
'ICommand.vb
Sub Execute(StringArgs As String, ListArgs As String(), ListArgsOnly As String(), ListSwitchesOnly As String())
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

'IArgument.vb
Sub Execute(StringArgs As String, ListArgs As String(), ListArgsOnly As String(), ListSwitchesOnly As String())
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
{% endcode %}

It seems that `ListArgs` is now no longer a reliable way to check for arguments, as it could be `null` when no argument is provided. While it contains a collection of switches and arguments, it's sequential. We have separated between switches and arguments as demonstrated in both the `ListArgsOnly` and `ListSwitchesOnly` arrays.

{% hint style="info" %}
Recent changes to the shell command parsing code have allowed reliable argument and switch parsing. Use the `ListArgsOnly` and `ListSwitchesOnly` arrays to process arguments and switches.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `GetEsc()` to `Misc.Text.CharManager`**

{% code title="Color255.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function GetEsc() As Char
```
{% endcode %}

`GetEsc()` is now widely used for color manipulation, but we need to move it to a better place as migration to `ColorSeq` is done.

{% code title="Color255.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module Color255
```
{% endcode %}

We have deleted `Color255` from `KS.ConsoleBase` as a result of this migration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to `GetEsc()` from `KS.ConsoleBase.Colors` to `KS.Misc.Text.CharManager`.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `FullArgumentList`**

{% code title="ProvidedCommandArgumentsInfo.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public ReadOnly Property FullArgumentsList As String()
```
{% endcode %}

Following the removal of `ListArgs()`, we can safely remove this property.

{% hint style="info" %}
Recent changes to the shell command parsing code have allowed reliable argument and switch parsing. Use the `ListArgsOnly` and `ListSwitchesOnly` arrays to process arguments and switches.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `ConsoleWriters.*.Write*Plain` in favor of the plain writers**

The plain writer interfaces feel like they're a great addition to control the console writers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the plain writers to replace the removed plain writers from the `ConsoleWriters`.
{% endhint %}

### **Updated debug and notifications namespaces**

We felt that moving debug-related functions to `KS.Kernel` would be more convenient, so we moved these functions to it. Also, we've renamed the notifications namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
The below namespaces were affected in this change:

* `KS.Misc.Writers.DebugWriters` -> `KS.Kernel.Debugging`
* `KS.Network.RemoteDebug` -> `KS.Kernel.Debugging.RemoteDebug`
* `KS.Misc.Notifiers` -> `KS.Misc.Notifications`
{% endhint %}

### **Merged `ParseCmd` with `ExecuteCommand`**

{% code title="RemoteDebugCmd.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Sub ParseCmd(CmdString As String, SocketStreamWriter As StreamWriter, Address As String)
```
{% endcode %}

It has come to the conclusion that `ParseCmd` is now very similar to `ExecuteCommand` with treating the remote debug shell specially. This is no longer needed as `ProvidedCommandArgumentsInfo` has been provided the IP address of the target device, making `ParseCmd` redundant.

{% hint style="info" %}
This function wasn't part of the public KS API. We advice you to cease using this function and start declaring your remote debug command.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `ExecuteRDAlias()`**

{% code title="AliasExecutor.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Sub ExecuteRDAlias(aliascmd As String, SocketStream As IO.StreamWriter, Address As String)
```
{% endcode %}

This function was not needed to execute aliases since there has been recent improvements to the executor in both 0.0.20.0 and 0.0.24.0.

{% hint style="info" %}
This function wasn't part of the public KS API. We advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### **Renamed debug writer function names**

{% code title="DebugWriter.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub Wdbg(Level As DebugLevel, text As String, ParamArray vars() As Object)
Public Sub WdbgConditional(ByRef Condition As Boolean, Level As DebugLevel, text As String, ParamArray vars() As Object)
Public Sub WdbgDevicesOnly(Level As DebugLevel, text As String, ParamArray vars() As Object)
Public Sub WStkTrcConditional(ByRef Condition As Boolean, Ex As Exception)
Public Sub WStkTrc(Ex As Exception)
```
{% endcode %}

We needed to do the same thing as we've renamed `W()` to `Write()`, so we renamed the following:

* `Wdbg()` -> `WriteDebug()`
* `WdbgConditional()` -> `WriteDebugConditional()`
* `WdbgDevicesOnly()` -> `WriteDebugDevicesOnly()`
* `WStkTrcConditional()` -> `WriteDebugStackTraceConditional()`
* `WStkTrc()` -> `WriteDebugStackTrace()`

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use these functions to write debugging information in your mods to the kernel debugger. The below method signatures are provided:
{% endhint %}

{% code title="DebugWriter.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void WriteDebug(DebugLevel Level, string text, params object[] vars)
public static void WriteDebugConditional(bool Condition, DebugLevel Level, string text, params object[] vars)
public static void WriteDebugDevicesOnly(DebugLevel Level, string text, params object[] vars)
public static void WriteDebugStackTraceConditional(bool Condition, Exception Ex)
public static void WriteDebugStackTrace(Exception Ex)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Moved MAL and MOTD message to `Misc.Probers.Motd`**

{% code title="Kernel.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public MOTDMessage, MAL As String
```
{% endcode %}

These have no relationship with the kernel directly.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to set the MOTD and MAL messages, you need to use the `SetMotd()` and `SetMal()` functions.
{% endhint %}

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void SetMotd(string Message)
public static void SetMal(string Message)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Moved `HostName` from Kernel to `NetworkTools`**

{% code title="Kernel.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public HostName As String
```
{% endcode %}

It has no relationship with the kernel either.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to change the hostname, you need to use the `ChangeHostname` function in `NetworkTools`.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="NetworkTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void ChangeHostname(string NewHost)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Made abstractions regarding the color management class**

The color management used to define so many variables for just one color type. Now, it has been simplified to ease the making of the new color type. Color types are renamed to match all files that mention the color type.

As a result, we have removed all separate variables for each color type and merged them to simplify the declaration.

Also, we have added `GetColor()` and `SetColor()` functions to `ColorTools` to perform operations on these color types.

### **Moved `ConfigCategory` outside `Config` class**

{% code title="Config.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Enum ConfigCategory
```
{% endcode %}

We have moved `ConfigCategory` outside the Config class to better organize the enumerations relating to the configuration.

### **Use `CommandArgumentInfo` in arguments**

{% code title="ArgumentInfo.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub New(Argument As String, Type As ArgumentType, HelpDefinition As String, HelpUsage As String, ArgumentsRequired As Boolean, MinimumArguments As Integer, ArgumentBase As ArgumentExecutor, Optional Obsolete As Boolean = False, Optional AdditionalHelpAction As Action = Nothing)
```
{% endcode %}

Using `CommandArgumentInfo` allows you to define argument information for commands. However, it's a powerful class for managing arguments for commands and kernel arguments themselves.

As a result, we've used `CommandArgumentInfo` in `ArgumentInfo`.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to change how you call the constructor of `ArgumentInfo` to hold the `CommandArgumentInfo` instance.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="ArgumentInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public ArgumentInfo(string Argument, string HelpDefinition, CommandArgumentInfo ArgArgumentInfo, ArgumentExecutor ArgumentBase, bool Obsolete = false, Action AdditionalHelpAction = null)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Removed `SetColors` as they're no longer used**

{% code title="ColorTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function TrySetColors(InputColor As String, LicenseColor As String, ContKernelErrorColor As String, UncontKernelErrorColor As String, HostNameShellColor As String, UserNameShellColor As String,
                             BackgroundColor As String, NeutralTextColor As String, ListEntryColor As String, ListValueColor As String, StageColor As String, ErrorColor As String, WarningColor As String,
                             OptionColor As String, BannerColor As String, NotificationTitleColor As String, NotificationDescriptionColor As String, NotificationProgressColor As String,
                             NotificationFailureColor As String, QuestionColor As String, SuccessColor As String, UserDollarColor As String, TipColor As String, SeparatorTextColor As String,
                             SeparatorColor As String, ListTitleColor As String, DevelopmentWarningColor As String, StageTimeColor As String, ProgressColor As String, BackOptionColor As String,
                             LowPriorityBorderColor As String, MediumPriorityBorderColor As String, HighPriorityBorderColor As String, TableSeparatorColor As String, TableHeaderColor As String,
                             TableValueColor As String, SelectedOptionColor As String, AlternativeOptionColor As String) As Boolean
Public Sub SetColors(InputColor As String, LicenseColor As String, ContKernelErrorColor As String, UncontKernelErrorColor As String, HostNameShellColor As String, UserNameShellColor As String,
                     BackgroundColor As String, NeutralTextColor As String, ListEntryColor As String, ListValueColor As String, StageColor As String, ErrorColor As String, WarningColor As String,
                     OptionColor As String, BannerColor As String, NotificationTitleColor As String, NotificationDescriptionColor As String, NotificationProgressColor As String,
                     NotificationFailureColor As String, QuestionColor As String, SuccessColor As String, UserDollarColor As String, TipColor As String, SeparatorTextColor As String,
                     SeparatorColor As String, ListTitleColor As String, DevelopmentWarningColor As String, StageTimeColor As String, ProgressColor As String, BackOptionColor As String,
                     LowPriorityBorderColor As String, MediumPriorityBorderColor As String, HighPriorityBorderColor As String, TableSeparatorColor As String, TableHeaderColor As String,
                     TableValueColor As String, SelectedOptionColor As String, AlternativeOptionColor As String)
```
{% endcode %}

We have improved the color tools module, so SetColors is no longer used. We've removed it for this reason. Use `SetColor()` instead.

{% hint style="info" %}
To set the kernel type to a specified color, use `SetColor()`.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="ColorTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static Color SetColor(KernelColorType type, Color color)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Changed algorithm enum to EncryptionAlgorithms**

{% code title="Encryption.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Enum Algorithms
```
{% endcode %}

As part of an ongoing change to the encryption driver, we've changed the algorithm enumeration to `EncryptionAlgorithms` outside the `Encryption` module.

{% hint style="info" %}
Encryption driver no longer uses the `EncryptionAlgorithms` enumeration, although it now handles custom algorithms. The enumeration can't be used anymore.
{% endhint %}

### **Renamed two classes related to shell**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Class ShellInfo
Public MustInherit Class ShellExecutor
    Implements IShell
```
{% endcode %}

We have renamed the below two shell-related classes to the ones that suit the narrative of the classes.

{% hint style="info" %}
These classes can still be called using the following names:

* `ShellInfo` -> `ShellExecuteInfo`
* `ShellExecutor` -> `BaseShell`
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `TextLocation` to `Misc.Text`**

{% code title="TextLocation.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Enum TextLocation
```
{% endcode %}

This is a text-related enumeration of text vertical location (top, bottom). It's used by the splashes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to this enumeration from `KS.Misc` to `KS.Misc.Text`.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `GetCommands` to `CommandManager`**

{% code title="GetCommand.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function GetCommands(ShellType As ShellType) As Dictionary(Of String, CommandInfo)
```
{% endcode %}

This sub is more of a command management routine than the "getting command" module work itself.

{% hint style="info" %}
`GetCommands()` has been moved from `GetCommand` module to `CommandManager` module.
{% endhint %}

### **Changed the entire event system**

{% code title="Events.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Class Events
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Kernel.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public ReadOnly KernelEventManager As New Events
```
{% endcode %}

We have moved all the events to its own dedicated array containing all the available events that the kernel introduced, removing the giant Events class and its variable, `KernelEventManager`, in the Kernel entry point class. This will reduce the need of importing the Kernel namespace and class everytime we need to directly manage the events.

Event firing and response functions are moved to the EventsManager class in one function, `FireEvent`.

{% hint style="info" %}
To fire events, you now have to use the FireEvent function found under the EventsManager module. Its method signature is printed below:
{% endhint %}

{% code title="EventsManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void FireEvent(EventType Event, params object[] Params)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Moved `NewLine` from `Kernel` to `CharManager`**

{% code title="Kernel.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public ReadOnly NewLine As String
```
{% endcode %}

This is actually a character management function and not a function directly to the kernel.

{% hint style="info" %}
This variable is now found under `KS.Misc.Text.CharManager`.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `KS.Login` to `KS.Users.Login`**

This has to do with the user management namespace, so we moved it to that namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to this enumeration from `KS.Login` to `KS.Users.Login`.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `Kernel[Api]Version` to `KernelTools`**

{% code title="Kernel.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
'From 0.0.24.0
Public ReadOnly KernelVersion As String
```
{% endcode %}

We didn't want the `Kernel` class to be publicly accessible, since it has been planned back at 0.0.1 as the class responsible for being an entry point. As a result, these variables, `KernelVersion` and `KernelApiVersion`, were successfully moved to `KernelTools`.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use these variables in their new location, change the reference from `Kernel` to `KernelTools`.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `ColoredShell`**

{% code title="Shell.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public ColoredShell As Boolean
```
{% endcode %}

The colors are now an essential part of KS, so we decided to take out support for uncolored shell.

### **Finally condensed `TableColor`**

{% code title="TableColor.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, Color As ConsoleColor, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, ForegroundColor As ConsoleColor, BackgroundColor As ConsoleColor, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, ColTypes As ColTypes, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, colorTypeForeground As ColTypes, colorTypeBackground As ColTypes, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, Color As Color, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
Public Sub WriteTable(Headers() As String, Rows(,) As String, Margin As Integer, ForegroundColor As Color, BackgroundColor As Color, Optional SeparateRows As Boolean = True, Optional CellOptions As List(Of CellOptions) = Nothing)
```
{% endcode %}

We noticed that the code is repetitive for making tables, and we don't want to update six locations every bug fix, so we decided to condense it to a single code.

As a side-effect, we've changed the color signatures from foreground and background pairs to header, value, separator, and background colors. Consequently, we've removed the `ConsoleColor` version of `TableColor` as we found it irrelevant thanks to the enhanced `Color` class found in the Terminaux library.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the new method signatures to write your table. As for the `ConsoleColor` version, we advice you to upgrade to `ConsoleColors` at minimum.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="TableColor.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void WriteTable(string[] Headers, string[,] Rows, int Margin, bool SeparateRows = true, List<CellOptions> CellOptions = null)
public static void WriteTable(string[] Headers, string[,] Rows, int Margin, KernelColorType colorTypeSeparatorForeground, KernelColorType colorTypeHeaderForeground, KernelColorType colorTypeValueForeground, KernelColorType colorTypeBackground, bool SeparateRows = true, List<CellOptions> CellOptions = null)
public static void WriteTable(string[] Headers, string[,] Rows, int Margin, ConsoleColors SeparatorForegroundColor, ConsoleColors HeaderForegroundColor, ConsoleColors ValueForegroundColor, ConsoleColors BackgroundColor, bool SeparateRows = true, List<CellOptions> CellOptions = null)
public static void WriteTable(string[] Headers, string[,] Rows, int Margin, Color SeparatorForegroundColor, Color HeaderForegroundColor, Color ValueForegroundColor, Color BackgroundColor, bool SeparateRows = true, List<CellOptions> CellOptions = null)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Tried to balance color support for writers**

Migration from `ConsoleColor` to `ConsoleColors` is complete. This means that all the writers in the `KS.Misc.*Writers` now have the `ConsoleColors` support.

The latest ColorSeq version, 1.0.2, will be used to make it easier to achieve.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's best to upgrade your `ConsoleColor` variables to `ConsoleColors` at minimum.
{% endhint %}

### **Renamed command executor and base to reduce confusion**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module GetCommand
Public MustInherit Class CommandExecutor
    Implements ICommand
```
{% endcode %}

Base command class had the name of `CommandExecutor`. However, it behaved like the base class for your mod commands, so we renamed it to `BaseCommand`. This caused us to rename the command execution class to `CommandExecutor`.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the new names, you have to rename the following in this order:

* `CommandExecutor` -> `BaseCommand`
* `GetCommand` -> `CommandExecutor`
{% endhint %}

### **Renamed `ConsoleSanityChecker` to `ConsoleChecker`**

{% code title="ConsoleSanityChecker.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module ConsoleSanityChecker
```
{% endcode %}

This class will be filled by many console checks, so renamed it according to the purpose.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the methods inside the class, rename the references from `ConsoleSanityChecker` -> `ConsoleChecker`.
{% endhint %}

### **`WriteWherePlain` from `TextWriterWhereColor` renamed**

{% code title="TextWriterWhereColor.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub WriteWherePlain(msg As String, Left As Integer, Top As Integer, ParamArray vars() As Object)
Public Sub WriteWherePlain(msg As String, Left As Integer, Top As Integer, [Return] As Boolean, ParamArray vars() As Object)
```
{% endcode %}

This change is necessary to fit in with the rest of the `ConsoleWriters`

{% hint style="info" %}
To continue using the plain writer, rename the references from `WriteWherePlain` -> `WriteWhere`.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `Screensaver.colors`**

{% code title="Screensaver.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public ReadOnly colors() As ConsoleColor = CType([Enum].GetValues(GetType(ConsoleColor)), ConsoleColor())
Public ReadOnly colors255() As ConsoleColors = CType([Enum].GetValues(GetType(ConsoleColors)), ConsoleColors())
```
{% endcode %}

This is to remove support for 255 colors in screensavers.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `KS.Network` classes to `KS.Network.Base`**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module NetworkAdapter
Public Module NetworkAdapterPrint
Public Module NetworkTools
```
{% endcode %}

These classes are believed to be the base classes for the networking. These classes are used for general networking purposes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to this enumeration from `KS.Network` to `KS.Network.Base`.
{% endhint %}

### **Condensed speed dial to `KS.Network.SpeedDial`**

The speed dial API wasn't touched for a long time, so we decided to condense the speed dial API to a single namespace to ease the addition of the speed dial feature to all the networking shells.

In consequence, the speed dial format has changed.

{% code title="Old format" lineNumbers="true" %}
```json
  "ftp.riken.jp": {
    "Address": "ftp.riken.jp",
    "Port": 21,
    "User": "anonymous",
    "Type": 0,
    "FTP Encryption Mode": 0
  },
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="New format" lineNumbers="true" %}
```json
  "ftp.us.debian.org": {
    "Address": "ftp.us.debian.org",
    "Port": 21,
    "Type": 0,
    "Options": [
      "anonymous",
      0
    ]
  }
```
{% endcode %}

The username and FTP encryption mode is now moved to Options, which is an array of options that the networking shells use. To convert your speed dial entries, you have to manually open all FTP and SFTP speed dial JSON files and make changes to transition from the old format to the new format.

### **Moved network transfer functions to `KS.Network.Base.Transfer`**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module NetworkTransfer
Public Class NetworkTransferInfo
Public Enum NetworkTransferType
```
{% endcode %}

We've done that to the base network classes, so why not do the same to the network transfer functions?

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to this enumeration from `KS.Network.Transfer` to `KS.Network.Base.Transfer`.
{% endhint %}

### **Kernel exception handling changed**

We have changed the way how the kernel exception handling works. We have simplified the code, merging all the exception classes to just one enumeration to help you filter kernel exceptions matching a specific exception.

This also helps us in making dynamic suggestions to specific error type in the future.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As a consequence, mods that use old handling now break, and should use this format to continue working as usual:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
catch (KernelException ke) when (ke.ExceptionType == KernelExceptionType.ErrorType)
```
{% endcode %}

...where `ErrorType` is an error type obtained from the `KernelExceptionType` enumeration.
{% endhint %}

### **Changed `GetFilteredPositions` to tuple**

{% code title="ConsoleExtensions.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub GetFilteredPositions(Text As String, ByRef Left As Integer, ByRef Top As Integer, ParamArray Vars() As Object)
```
{% endcode %}

To aid in simplicity of the function, we've replaced the two reference variables with the tuples in their respective orders of cursor left and top positions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first tuple value in the returned value specifies the filtered X position, and the second one specifies the filtered Y position in the console buffer.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="ConsoleExtensions.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static (int, int) GetFilteredPositions(string Text, params object[] Vars)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Internalized several kernel tools**

{% code title="KernelTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub KernelError(ErrorType As KernelErrorLevel, Reboot As Boolean, RebootTime As Long, Description As String, Exc As Exception, ParamArray Variables() As Object)
Sub GeneratePanicDump(Description As String, ErrorType As KernelErrorLevel, Exc As Exception)
Sub ResetEverything()
Sub InitEverything(Args() As String)
Sub FactoryReset()
Sub ReportNewStage(StageNumber As Integer, StageText As String)
```
{% endcode %}

These tools could be abused, so we decided to privatize these tools.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using these functions.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed `PrepareDict`**

{% code title="Translate.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function PrepareDict(lang As String) As Dictionary(Of String, String)
```
{% endcode %}

`PrepareDict` used to populate the string dictionary with definitions to the localized string. Now, because the language management routine was remodeled, we've removed `PrepareDict` as part of the change.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The language manager automatically does this each time your mod sets the language, so we advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed network adapter querying**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
'NetworkAdapter.vb
Public Function IsInternetAdapter(InternetAdapter As NetworkInterface) As Boolean

'NetworkAdapterPrint.vb
Public Sub PrintAdapterProperties()
Sub PrintAdapterIPv4Info(NInterface As NetworkInterface, Properties As IPv4InterfaceProperties, Statistics As IPv4InterfaceStatistics, AdapterNumber As Long)
Sub PrintAdapterIPv6Info(NInterface As NetworkInterface, Properties As IPv6InterfaceProperties, AdapterNumber As Long)
Sub PrintGeneralNetInfo(IPv4Stat As IPGlobalStatistics, IPv6Stat As IPGlobalStatistics)
```
{% endcode %}

The network adapter querying functionality was implemented in 0.0.3. This functionality was no longer maintained as it wasn't tweaked.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this functionality.
{% endhint %}

### **Theme preview is no longer exclusive to theme studio**

{% code title="ThemeStudioTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Sub PreparePreview()
```
{% endcode %}

The theme preview routine used to depend on the theme studio to do its job, under the name of `ThemeStudioTools.PreparePreview()`. However, because there were recent improvements to the theming system, we've finally condensed the preview routine to `ThemeTools.PreviewTheme()`. You can no longer use the old method, because it also required loading the theme information to the theme studio itself. What if it was called in a context that has no relationship with the theme studio, such as in the case of `themesel`?

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use the new `ThemeTools.PreviewTheme()` function to preview any theme. The method signatures are written below.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="ThemeTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void PreviewTheme(string theme)
public static void PreviewTheme(ThemeInfo theme)
public static void PreviewTheme(Dictionary<KernelColorType, Color> colors)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Migrated kernel arguments**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Enum ArgumentType
Public Module CommandLineArgs
Public Module ArgumentPrompt
```
{% endcode %}

We used to provide two argument channels: one for the command-line kernel arguments, and one for the kernel arguments. The entry point has been provided the `Args` variable to get all the arguments from the command line. Since it has undergone recent improvements to the system, we've decided to remove the kernel arguments channel, so we don't have to parse the passed arguments twice.

We also had to remove the `arginj` command, one of the commands that made appearance in first-generation versions of KS.

### **Removed `GetCompilerVars`**

{% code title="KernelTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function GetCompilerVars() As String()
```
{% endcode %}

This was only useful in conditions where getting the compiler variables for determining the kernel milestone is needed, which was seldom needed by mods. We've removed it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### **Migrated encryptors to Kernel Drivers**

The kernel drivers are beneficial, so we decided to give the encryptors a chance to appear in kernel drivers. This caused us to remove `EncryptionAlgorithms` and `IEncryptor` and replace them with `IEncryptionDriver`, handled by the kernel driver handler.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can implement your own encryptor by registering your custom encryption driver using the `RegisterDriver` function.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="DriverHandler.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void RegisterDriver(DriverTypes type, IDriver driver)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Removed `TwoNewlines` argument from `WriteLicense`**

{% code title="WelcomeMessage.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Sub WriteLicense(TwoNewlines As Boolean)
```
{% endcode %}

This argument was unused, so we decided to remove it from `WriteLicense()`.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this variable.
{% endhint %}

### **Renamed `PartInfo` to `ModPartInfo`**

{% code title="PartInfo.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Class PartInfo
```
{% endcode %}

Add `Mod` next to `PartInfo` to clarify which module uses this.

{% hint style="info" %}
To implement your new mod parts, construct the `ModPartInfo` class. For existing mod parts, rename `PartInfo` to `ModPartInfo`.
{% endhint %}

### **Manual pages moved to `Modifications`**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Class Manual
Public Module PageManager
Module PageParser
Public Module PageViewer
```
{% endcode %}

These manual pages are used by mods to host documentation, so we moved it to `KS.Modifications.ManPages` to reflect its purpose.

{% hint style="info" %}
Change the namespace declaration to refer to this enumeration from `KS.ManPages` to `KS.Modifications.ManPages`.
{% endhint %}

### **Changed `Notifications` to `NotificationManager`**

{% code title="Notifications.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module Notifications
```
{% endcode %}

We felt that both the `Notification` and `Notifications` classes are confusing for some people, so we decided to make these clearer by renaming the `Notifications` class to `NotificationManager`

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the methods inside the class, rename the references from `Notifications` -> `NotificationManager`.
{% endhint %}

### **Removed getting property value in variable**

{% code title="PropertyManager.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function GetPropertyValueInVariable(Variable As String, [Property] As String) As Object
Public Function GetPropertyValueInVariable(Variable As String, [Property] As String, VariableType As Type) As Object
```
{% endcode %}

VariableProperty is no longer used, so we decided to remove it. As a consequence, we also had to remove the `PropertyManager.GetPropertyValueInVariable()` routine.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using these functions.
{% endhint %}

### **Moved `ColTypes` to `KernelColorType`**

{% code title="ColorTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Enum ColTypes As Integer
```
{% endcode %}

This is an enumeration which simply tells the difference of all the defined and known kernel color types. We have moved ColTypes to KernelColorType.

{% hint style="info" %}
To continue using the kernel color type enumeration, rename the references from `ColTypes` to `KernelColorType`, importing the `KS.ConsoleBase.Colors` namespace.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="KernelColorType.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public enum KernelColorType
```
{% endcode %}

### **Removed `ref` from conditional debug writers**

{% code title="DebugWriter.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub WdbgConditional(ByRef Condition As Boolean, Level As DebugLevel, text As String, ParamArray vars() As Object)
Public Sub WStkTrcConditional(ByRef Condition As Boolean, Ex As Exception)
```
{% endcode %}

The conditional debug writers didn't do anything to the boolean condition that caused it to change its state, so we decided to pass the boolean value by value and not by reference.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remove the `ref` prefix from the boolean variable that is being tested from your conditional debug writer calls. Follow the below method signatures:
{% endhint %}

{% code title="DebugWriters.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void WriteDebugConditional(bool Condition, DebugLevel Level, string text, params object[] vars)
public static void WriteDebugStackTraceConditional(bool Condition, Exception Ex)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Removed `GroupManagement` (a.k.a. `PermissionManagement`)**

{% code title="PermissionManagement.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module PermissionManagement
```
{% endcode %}

The `GroupManagement` module was removed in preparation for the new permission system. The groups were moved outside in the users JSON file to become singular boolean variables, and the permission system was implemented under the `KS.Users.Permissions` namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
To grant or revoke individual permissions from a specified user, use the following functions:

* `GrantPermission`
* `RevokePermission`

You may need to import the `KS.Users.Permissions` namespace to use this feature, although it works on all permissions, unlike the superuser variable which grants all permissions.

Their method signatures are written below.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="PermissionsTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void GrantPermission(string User, PermissionTypes permissionType)
public static void RevokePermission(string User, PermissionTypes permissionType)
```
{% endcode %}

### **Removed obsolete functions**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
'Input.vb
Public Function ReadLineUntil(ByRef Condition As Boolean) As String

'ThreadManager.vb
Public Sub SleepNoBlock(Time As Long, ThreadWork As BackgroundWorker)

'NetworkTools.vb
Public Sub ConvertSpeedDialEntries(SpeedDialType As SpeedDialType)
```
{% endcode %}

`ReadLineUntil()`, `SleepNoBlock()`, and `ConvertSpeedDialEntries()` were removed for being obsolete. The first function was removed in favor of ReadLine.Reboot and TermRead, the second function was removed for the absence of our usage of `BackgroundWorker`, and the third function was removed as a result of huge improvements to the speed dial functionality that makes it incompatible with the older speed dial format.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using these functions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
To sleep without blocking, convert all your BackgroundWorkers to KernelThread and use the appropriate SleepNoBlock overload for your kernel thread. The below method signature is shown.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="ThreadManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void SleepNoBlock(long Time, KernelThread ThreadWork)
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may have to convert your speed dial entries manually. The instructions will be done soon. Please stay tuned!
{% endhint %}

### Argument auto-completion re-implemented

{% code title="CommandArgumentInfo.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub New(HelpUsages() As String, ArgumentsRequired As Boolean, MinimumArguments As Integer, Optional AutoCompleter As Func(Of String()) = Nothing)
```
{% endcode %}

Command auto-completion used to be available on ReadLine.Reboot to automatically complete the command needed to run. However, ReadLine.Reboot has come to an end, so we decided to re-implement it to align with TermRead.

As a result, the auto completion facility in your shell, if it has one implemented in your `CommandArgumentInfo`, will have to be re-implemented to parse the whole command passed to the auto-completion builder, `AutoCompleter`, and generate suggestions based on that data.

In your `CommandInfo` implementation of your command, you'll also have to re-implement it so that the auto-completer takes three arguments. You can always discard the index and delimiters argument in your action declaration: `(Text, _, _) => Function(Text)`.

{% code title="CommandArgumentInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] Arguments, SwitchInfo[] Switches, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, bool AcceptsSet = false, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
```
{% endcode %}

### Converted kernel exceptions

Previously, we've used the built-in .NET exceptions to catch appropriate exceptions based on the context of an error. Since `KernelException` was implemented as part of the first development semester of Nitrocid KS 0.1.0, we decided to throw all the exceptions to `KernelException` that dynamically provides extended information as to what's wrong, coupled together with possible suggestions and extra messages.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to throw these exceptions, you must now route all your exception handlers in your mods to target `KernelException` and check the exception type before you can take action. Converted exceptions are found in [this commit](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/commit/1d4d31cd12087659b807687d286047013a22273b).
{% endhint %}

### Removed decisive writers

{% code title="Decisive.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub DecisiveWrite(CommandType As ShellType, DebugDeviceSocket As StreamWriter, Text As String, Line As Boolean, colorType As ColTypes, ParamArray vars() As Object)
```
{% endcode %}

We used to implement the decisive writers to decide whether to use the normal console writer or to use the remote debug connection according to the shell type. Over time, the remote debug shell was removed and later implemented as a standalone add-on for the remote debugger. This leads to us removing this decisive writer from the `MiscWriters` namespace.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### Moved `PlaceParse` to `KS.Misc.Probers.Placeholder`

{% code title="PlaceParse.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Module PlaceParse
```
{% endcode %}

This module used to statically replace all the text placeholders found within the text with their values. It used to exist in the `KS.Misc.Probers` namespace, but we moved it to the `KS.Misc.Probers.Placeholder` namespace to align with the latest Nitrocid KS API design. It also earned a new way to dynamically parse the placeholders.

{% hint style="info" %}
The function names and the module itself are unchanged, but we just need you to change the namespace import to the abovementioned namespace.
{% endhint %}

### Removed `KernelColorType.Gray`

{% code title="ColorTools.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
''' <summary>
''' Gray color (for special purposes)
''' </summary>
Gray
```
{% endcode %}

This color type was used as a special color type intended to indicate that the element highlighted is colorless. Since we already have `ColorTools.GetGray()` to get the gray color according to the background color, and since this color type is just a wrapper to this function, we decided to remove this kernel color type.

{% hint style="info" %}
Instead of using `KernelColorType.Gray`, use the `ColorTools.GetGray()` function to get the gray color.
{% endhint %}

### Replaced `GetVariables()` with `Variables` property

{% code title="UESHVariables.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Function GetVariables() As Dictionary(Of String, String)
```
{% endcode %}

This function used to return a list of available UESH variables. It's been replaced with a property that does exactly the same thing. It's to make your mod code related to UESH variables easier to read.

{% hint style="info" %}
Replace all calls to `UESHVariables.GetVariables()` with `Variables`.
{% endhint %}

### Removed remote-debug-related argument from `ShowHelp()`

{% code title="HelpSystem.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Public Sub ShowHelp(command As String, CommandType As ShellType, Optional DebugDeviceSocket As StreamWriter = Nothing)
                                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
{% endcode %}

Remote debug shell used to require the `DebugDeviceSocket` parameter to be passed to `ShowHelp` for `DecisiveWriter` to decide what type of console is going to be written to. Since `DecisiveWriter` got removed and the remote debug shell was re-implemented to be standalone, we decided to remove this parameter.

{% hint style="info" %}
There was no need to pass `DebugDeviceSocket` to this function anyways. If you really need to use it, make your own remote debug command with the help entry, and Nitrocid KS will take care of the rest.
{% endhint %}

### Renamed few classes

{% code title="TimeDate.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Namespace TimeDate
    Public Module TimeDate
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="IScript.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Namespace Modifications
    Public Interface IScript
```
{% endcode %}

`TimeDate` used to host all the time and date general properties and functions. However, its access required to reference the namespace and then the class, because both the namespace and the class have the same name. As a result, the `TimeDate` class is renamed to `TimeDateTools` for easier access.

Also, `IScript` used to be the heart of the kernel modifications. It's renamed to `IMod` since it doesn't have to do with the UESH scripts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your mods should change the implementation interface name of the mod, `IScript`, to the new name, `IMod`, as it's more fitting. This will break all mods.

For the time and date functions, use the new class name, `TimeDateTools`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the methods and properties on the two above classes are changed.
{% endhint %}

## From 0.1.0 Beta 1

### Employed `ColorPrint.Core` for color wheel

{% code title="ColorWheelOpen.vb" lineNumbers="true" %}
```visual-basic
Namespace ConsoleBase.Colors
    Public Module ColorWheelOpen
```
{% endcode %}

The color wheel was implemented in the kernel to allow color selection. However, it lacked features such as the color blindness simulation, so we decided to make an entirely new library dedicated to this. As a result, we've replaced the kernel's implementation with `ColorPrint.Core`, which is more portable and easier to use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Merge your calls to the `ColorWheelOpen` class to `ColorPrint.Core` as it's easier to use and more portable than the former class.
{% endhint %}

### Removed the country-based RSS feed selector

{% code title="RSSTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void OpenFeedSelector()
```
{% endcode %}

The feed selector used to prompt you for a country so that you can select a feed according to the minimal list of known RSS feeds operating from the selected country. Recently, we've discovered many broken links (404's) across many feeds, so we decided to remove it as the source was out of date.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Its functionality will be replaced with the bookmarked feed selector. Meanwhile, it's advisable to stop using this function on your mods.
{% endhint %}

### Removed `UseCtrlCAsInput` from `ReadLine()`'s

{% code title="Input.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static string ReadLine(bool UseCtrlCAsInput)
public static string ReadLine(string InputText, string DefaultValue, bool UseCtrlCAsInput)
public static string ReadLineUnsafe(string InputText, string DefaultValue, bool UseCtrlCAsInput)
```
{% endcode %}

`UseCtrlCAsInput` used to tell ReadLine.Reboot to treat `Ctrl + C` as input to try to aid in cancelling prompts. Apparently, that library was deprecated and replaced with TermRead. As a result, this feature is removed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this variable in the above functions.
{% endhint %}

### Removed `SaveCurrDir()`

{% code title="CurrentDirectory.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void SaveCurrDir()
public static bool TrySaveCurrDir()
```
{% endcode %}

This function used to save the current directory value to the kernel configuration file stored in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%/KS/KernelMainConfig.json` for Windows or the `$HOME/.config/ks/KernelMainConfig.json`. Following the recent improvements in the configuration system that took place two times during 0.1.0's development, the `SaveCurrDir()` function was effectively reduced to a single call to the `Config.CreateConfig()` function, which already deals with this kind of change, rendering this function useless. As a result, we decided to remove this function as it added no value and was just an extraneous wrapper function.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to save the current directory value in the future, please use the kernel settings application to save the configuration. Programmatically, you'll have to call the `Config.CreateConfig()` function instead of the two above functions.
{% endhint %}

### Group system and the User Management API

{% code title="UserManagement.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void LoadUserToken()
public static JToken GetUserProperty(string User, UserProperty PropertyType)
public static void SetUserProperty(string User, UserProperty PropertyType, JToken Value)
public static void InitializeSystemAccount()
```
{% endcode %}

We've added a real group system to the KS.Users namespace under Groups in order to group the users and give them shared permissions. In consequence, we had to rework the user management system, causing several API removals.

The following functions were documented:

* `LoadUserToken()`: Tries to manually deserialize the user configuration JSON file to be usable with all the user management functions.
* `InitializeSystemAccount()`: Tries to initialize a root account with a defined password from the same user token.
* `GetUserProperty()`: Gets a user property as a JSON token, JToken, which has to be manually cast to either a string, boolean, or array of strings.
* `SetUserProperty()`: Sets a user property, taking an uncasted JSON token that represents either a string, boolean, or array of strings.

The first two functions were removed, because they were deemed to be unnecessary for a long time. A re-work to the user management API made it reasonable to remove these functions.

However, the last two functions were removed because it was found to be complicated for having to cast to their appropriate types manually. We also removed the ability to directly set a user's properties security-wise.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Because the user management API reached to a stage when it was re-written to simplify things, we advice you to cease using these functions.
{% endhint %}

### Initial implementation of the TUI

The following classes are affected:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class ContactsManagerCli
public static class TaskManagerCli
public static class FileManagerCli
```
{% endcode %}

The following functions are affected:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void OpenMain()
```
{% endcode %}

The three CLIs used to implement their own CLI based on data for contacts, kernel threads, and files respectively. Now, with the introduction of the `IInteractiveTui` interface and the `BaseInteractiveTui` class, we've made the three above classes implement both the classes, removing the `static` modifier from the three CLIs.

As a result, we've removed the `OpenMain()` function from all of them. However, you can still open the CLI as follows:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
InteractiveTuiTools.OpenInteractiveTui(new ContactsManagerCli());
InteractiveTuiTools.OpenInteractiveTui(new TaskManagerCli());
InteractiveTuiTools.OpenInteractiveTui(new FileManagerCli());
```
{% endcode %}

This removal was necessary to avoid code repetition, effectively making maintenance easier.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to open the three CLIs, refer to the above code snippet about the usage of `OpenInteractiveTui()`.
{% endhint %}

### Added warning reports to the splash interface

{% code title="ISplash.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
void ReportWarning(int Progress, string WarningReport, Exception ExceptionInfo, params object[] Vars);
```
{% endcode %}

The splash reporter used to only report the progress and the error messages during the kernel startup. Now, we've added warnings to extend the possibility of accurately reporting warnings without having to rely on special conditions on the progress report.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mods that implement splashes now have to implement the above function to be able to report warnings.
{% endhint %}

### Added `ReadToEndAndSeek()` to filesystem driver

{% code title="IFilesystemDriver.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
string ReadToEndAndSeek(ref StreamReader stream);
```
{% endcode %}

As part of the removal of Extensification dependency from Nitrocid KS as a result of its deprecation, we decided to adapt the kernel to remove all references to Extensification and re-implement things. The commit states:

> Since this library is deprecated starting today, we've removed all references to Extensification by updating all libraries and making necessary changes to the API to restore the used Extensification functions to `TextTools`, `IntegerTools`, and `StreamRead`. Custom filesystem drivers in your mods will now have to implement `ReadToEndAndSeek()` to be compatible with this revision of N-KS, so we've increased the mod API version to `3.0.25.7`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mods that implement filesystem drivers now have to implement the above function to be able to be installed on N-KS mod API 3.0.25.7 or later.
{% endhint %}

### Removed `ConsoleWrapper.WindowTop`

{% code title="ConsoleWrapper.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static int WindowTop
```
{% endcode %}

`Console.WindowTop` is always 0 on both the Windows and the Unix operating systems, but you can set this value only on Windows systems, which kills the potential of cross-platform. This is deemed unnecessary for most of the things, which makes it redundant, so we've removed this function from both the `ConsoleWrapper` and the `Console` driver.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to replace all instances of this function from `ConsoleWrapper` with `0`, and remove all implementations of this property from all your `Console` drivers.
{% endhint %}

### Converted string char variables to chars

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public string CustomUpperLeftCornerChar { get; set; } = "â•”";
public string CustomUpperRightCornerChar { get; set; } = "â•—";
public string CustomLowerLeftCornerChar { get; set; } = "â•š";
(...)
```
{% endcode %}

The above char variables used to hold only one character, but they were defined as strings instead of chars, so users made it possible to place more than one character to these variables. Usually, the handlers only take the first character from the string.

Since the config entries defined these variables as configurable under the `SChar` type, the config app made enough checking to make sure that only one character can be input. This caused us to convert all these variables to strings, affecting the following classes:

* `NotificationManager`
* `Notification`
* `BarRotSettings`
* `IndeterminateSettings`
* `ProgressClockSettings`
* `RampSettings`
* `BorderTools`
* `ProgressTools`

The following writers are also affected and are found to be using characters as strings before the change:

* `WriteBorder()` and `WriteBorderPlain()`
* `WriteBoxFrame()` and `WriteBoxFramePlain()`
* `WriteInfoBox()` and `WriteInfoBoxPlain()`
* `WriteProgress()` and `WriteProgressPlain()`
* `WriteVerticalProgress()` and `WriteVerticalProgressPlain()`

{% hint style="info" %}
For mods that treat characters as strings and use one of the above classes and variables that hold only one character, you'll have to refactor the logic to treat these characters as chars. However, if you use char variables and convert them to string in either the writers or the char variables, such as `CustomLowerLeftCornerChar`, you'll no longer need to convert your char variables to strings.
{% endhint %}

### Added finding files using regular expressions

The following functions are added to the filesystem driver:

{% code title="IFilesystemDriver.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
string[] GetFilesystemEntriesRegex(string Parent, string Pattern, bool Recursive = false);
```
{% endcode %}

This function gets all the filesystem entries found under the specified parent directory, with the regular expression pattern. This uses the regular expression driver to handle the regex work.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mods that implement filesystem drivers now have to implement the above function to be able to use it. It's also advisable to use the regex driver in the function implementation.
{% endhint %}

### Removed configurable maintenance mode

{% code title="Flags.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static bool Maintenance
```
{% endcode %}

Long ago, we used to allow users to force the kernel to maintenance mode upon setting this value right from the configuration application. However, this can be abused, so we decided to remove it as a configuration entry, but the mode itself stays. You can still run the kernel in maintenance mode by passing `maintenance` as a command line argument to Nitrocid's entry point. Refer to the below page for more information:

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-and-power-users/inner-workings/inner-essentials/kernel-arguments.md" %}
[kernel-arguments.md](../../advanced-and-power-users/inner-workings/inner-essentials/kernel-arguments.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this flag. Maintenance mode doesn't allow mods to load, anyways.
{% endhint %}

### Migrated two speed dial types to one JSON file

{% code title="Paths.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static string FTPSpeedDialPath
public static string SFTPSpeedDialPath
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="PathType.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// FTP speed dial file.
/// </summary>
FTPSpeedDial,
/// <summary>
/// SFTP speed dial file.
/// </summary>
SFTPSpeedDial,
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="SpeedDialTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static KernelPathType GetPathTypeFromSpeedDialType(SpeedDialType SpeedDialType)
public static JObject GetTokenFromSpeedDial(SpeedDialType SpeedDialType)
public static Dictionary<string, JToken> ListSpeedDialEntries(SpeedDialType SpeedDialType)
public static JToken GetQuickConnectInfo(SpeedDialType SpeedDialType)
```
{% endcode %}

To migrate two different JSON files holding speed dial entries for FTP and SFTP servers, we decided to replace `FTPSpeedDial` and `SFTPSpeedDial` with `SpeedDial` and `FTPSpeedDialPath` and `SFTPSpeedDialPath` with `SpeedDialPath`, effectively removing a function from `SpeedDialTools`, `GetPathTypeFromSpeedDialType()`, and the remaining functions removing the `(SpeedDialType SpeedDialType)` signature, causing them not to take any speed dial type.

The commit said:

> This migration is necessary to efficiently put speed dials to one JSON file as we have the Type key already in speed dial properties.

{% hint style="info" %}
We advice you to replace all calls to type-specific enumerations and paths with a single speed dial enumeration value, `SpeedDial`, and path, `SpeedDialPath`, respectively. Also, we advice you to use the three functions that stay, but without the type, and cease using the `GetPathTypeFromSpeedDialType()` function.
{% endhint %}

### Added support for `SwitchInfo`

{% code title="CommandArgumentInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public HelpUsage[] HelpUsages { get; private set; }
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] HelpUsages, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
public CommandArgumentInfo(HelpUsage[] HelpUsages, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="HelpUsage.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public class HelpUsage
```
{% endcode %}

`CommandArgumentInfo` and the UESH shell used to hold `HelpUsage` classes to get info about help usages, but they didn't become aware of unknown switches, so we decided to split `HelpUsage` to a string of command arguments and command switches, using `SwitchInfo` as a class to hold help information for each switch, including the properties for each switch, like the requirement and the value requirement.

This causes us to remove all help helpers that hold info about the supported switches, especially since the later commands that do support switches didn't have their help helpers that tell the users about the command switches.

In consequence, `CommandArgumentInfo` has been changed to hold only one constructor that holds both array of arguments and array of switch information class instances.

{% hint style="info" %}
We advice you to use the below constructor to accommodate the above changes made:

```csharp
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] Arguments, SwitchInfo[] Switches, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, bool AcceptsSet = false, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
```
{% endhint %}

An example is provided below:

{% code title="Snippet from UESHShellInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
{ "find",
    new CommandInfo("find", ShellType, /* Localizable */ "Finds a file in the specified directory or in the current directory",
        new[] {
            new CommandArgumentInfo(new[] { "file", "directory" }, new[] {
                new SwitchInfo("recursive", /* Localizable */ "Searches for a file recursively", false, false, Array.Empty<string>(), 0, false),
                new SwitchInfo("exec", /* Localizable */ "Executes a command on a file", false, true)
            }, true, 1, true)
        }, new FindCommand())
},
```
{% endcode %}

### Migrated text tools

{% code title="Deleted classes" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class StringManipulate
public static class StringQuery
```
{% endcode %}

As `TextTools` matured with different string tools, we decided to migrate the following functions from their respective classes to that class under the `KS.Misc.Text` namespace:

* `FormatString(string Format, params object[] Vars)`
* `IsStringNumeric(string Expression)`

{% hint style="info" %}
As a result, we advice you to use the `TextTools` class to execute the above two functions. Their signatures and behavior remains unchanged. This means removing any reference to the two classes found under the `KS.Misc.Reflection` namespace.
{% endhint %}

### Moved `BannerFigletFont` to `WelcomeMessage`

{% code title="KernelTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static string BannerFigletFont =>
    Config.MainConfig.BannerFigletFont;
```
{% endcode %}

As this property doesn't have to do with the kernel tools, we decided to move from the `KernelTools` class to the `WelcomeMessage` class found under the `KS.Misc.Writers.MiscWriters` namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to continue using this property, we suggest that you change the `using KS.Kernel` line to replace the namespace with the `KS.Misc.Writers.MiscWriters` namespace in order to be able to reference `BannerFigletFont` under `WelcomeMessage`.
{% endhint %}

### Easier way to render info into the second pane

{% code title="IInteractiveTui.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public string RenderInfoOnSecondPane(object item)
```
{% endcode %}

When we first introduced the interactive TUI feature, we had to leave the entire "rendering to the second pane" logic to your interactive TUI instance. However, since this involves having to wrap the informational pane and to work out the text lengths and console positions yourself, we've placed these requirements so that it's up to the handler to handle printing the information, effectively replacing the function above with `GetInfoFromItem`.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's now easier to render the information pane using just your text! Just form your final informational text by implementing the `GetInfoFromItem` function to return said information. The function signature is found below:

```csharp
public string GetInfoFromItem(object item)
```
{% endhint %}

### Enhanced the screen locking feature

{% code title="Login.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void ShowPasswordPrompt(string usernamerequested)
```
{% endcode %}

The screen locking feature was malfunctioning for a long time. Unfortunately, it went under the radar, so it wasn't looked at. We've finally managed to enhance the screen locking feature by checking our heuristics. Moreover, we had to separate the `ShowPasswordPrompt` function from trying to log the user in, as this was the requirement in enhancing the screen lock, since it was used by this feature.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `ShowPasswordPrompt` function now contains a return type of `bool`, which returns `true` if the password was valid or if the user database concluded that the password was empty, and `false` if the password was invalid. The new signature is now:

{% code title="Login.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static bool ShowPasswordPrompt(string usernamerequested)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}

### Moved journaling related classes to `KS.Kernel.Journaling`

{% code title="JournalManager.cs, JournalStatus.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Kernel.Administration.Journalling
```
{% endcode %}

We used to place all the journaling-related classes and tools to the `KS.Kernel.Administration.Journalling` namespace, until we've found out that said namespace wasn't needed because we didn't have plans to add another namespace to the `Administration` namespace, so we decided to move journaling-related classes to the `KS.Kernel.Journaling` namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
To continue using these journaling classes, you have to change the `using` statements to point to `KS.Kernel.Journaling`.
{% endhint %}

### Time and Date API enhancements

{% code title="Old TimeDate namespace" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.TimeDate
```
{% endcode %}

The TimeDate API was left untouched for a long time, and its structure was a bit too old for the modern API system that Nitrocid KS uses to be usable for mods and general purpose, so we have decided to create the following namespaces:

* `KS.Kernel.Time.Converters`
* `KS.Kernel.Time.Renderers`
* `KS.Kernel.Time.Timezones`
* `KS.Kernel.Time`

We have moved relevant functions according to their action to the above namespaces. For example, the `Render()` function was moved to `TimeDateRenderers` class in the `Renderers` namespace.

We have also isolated the `FormatType` enumeration from the `TimeDateTools` class so that the mods don't have to reference the class name in order to access this enumeration.

Also, some functions like `GetRemainingTimeFromNow()` have their return types changed from `string` to `TimeSpan`. To get a string, you must now use the `RenderRemainingTimeFromNow()` function to continue using strings to render the remaining time from the current date and time.

{% hint style="info" %}
To keep using these functions, you must now change the imports in relevant code files to `KS.Kernel.Time` and its ancestors to be able to use their classes. You may need to adjust your usage of the functions and/or classes so that the behavior you're expecting remains unchanged.
{% endhint %}

### Manual page parsing now uses the interactive TUI

The manual page viewer used to be so limited in features; you could only advance to the next pages of the manual and exit back to the shell. You had to specify the full manual page title after listing it with the `-list` switch.

The migration of the viewer to the TUI required the following changes:

{% code title="PageManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static Dictionary<string, Manual> ListAllPages()
public static Dictionary<string, Manual> ListAllPages(string SearchTerm)
```
{% endcode %}

The above functions have their return values changed to a `List<Manual>` type. It was done because we needed to store a kernel modification name inside the `Manual` instance, so we have done the below changes:

{% code title="PageManager.cs and PageParser.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void AddManualPage(string Name, Manual Page)
public static void InitMan(string ManualFile)
```
{% endcode %}

The two above functions have changed their signature so they they take a mod name (`string modName`) before every element.

{% code title="PageManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static bool RemoveManualPage(string Name)
```
{% endcode %}

The above function has its signature changed so that instead of the manual page name (title), it now takes an instance of the `Manual` class to remove a selected manual page.

{% hint style="info" %}
You should adjust the changes as necessary in order for your mod to continue working.
{% endhint %}

### `ChoiceOutputType` is now standalone

{% code title="ChoiceStyle.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public enum ChoiceOutputType
```
{% endcode %}

We have separated the `ChoiceOutputType` enumeration from the `ChoiceStyle` class so that we can simplify its access. Now, you can access this enumeration directly; you don't have to append `ChoiceStyle` before the enumeration so that it becomes easier for you to access.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to remove the ChoiceStyle reference and make it only reference the ChoiceOutputType enumeration so that your mods keep working. For example:

<pre class="language-csharp" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-csharp">// Before
<strong>    var OutputType = ChoiceStyle.ChoiceOutputType.OneLine;
</strong>                     XXXXXXXXXXX
// After
<strong>    var OutputType = ChoiceOutputType.OneLine;
</strong>                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
{% endhint %}

### Breaking changes following the `OpenConnectionForShell()` implementation

{% code title="IShellInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
bool AcceptsNetworkConnection { get; }
```
{% endcode %}

In order for `OpenConnectionForShell()` to be able to distinguish the shells that accept the network connections from the shells that don't, we needed to add the above property to the interface implementation of the `ShellInfo` class. The base class has been updated so that it implements the above property as false so that you don't have to override this property in the non-networked shells implemented either by Nitrocid or by your mods:

{% code title="BaseShellInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public virtual bool AcceptsNetworkConnection => false;
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For most shells that don't connect to any network, you don't have to override the above property. Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 with API versions lower than 3.0.25.34 are unable to use `ShellInfo` instances implemented for such versions.
{% endhint %}

### Renamed Shell to ShellManager

{% code title="Shell.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class Shell
```
{% endcode %}

The shell management module used to have just `Shell` without the `Manager` suffix, because it was introduced on 0.0.1, which was the first version of Kernel Simulator as a whole that released on February 22nd, 2018. You can view the historical representation of the shell management class by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/blob/v0.0.1.x-servicing/src/Windows/0.0.1/Kernel%20Simulator/Shell.vb).

However, this naming has introduced problems for us because we needed to write `Shell` twice before being able to write its function names for reference, which is messy. As a result, we had to rename this class to `ShellManager` so that its access is easier.

{% hint style="info" %}
We advice you to change the references to the `Shell` class to use the `ShellManager` class.
{% endhint %}

### `ColorTools` class renamed to `KernelColorTools`

{% code title="ColorTools.cs and ColorSetErrorReasons.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class ColorTools
public enum ColorSetErrorReasons
```
{% endcode %}

The `ColorTools` class used to hold color tools which have to do directly with the kernel and its console driver so that it can manipulate with the colors, like setting the console color, setting the console background color, and so on.

However, it has been recently concluded that there is a class under the same name from the ColorSeq library, which caused us to have to add an extra imports clause to rename the `ColorTools` class so that it doesn't conflict with ColorSeq's class.

We were being fed up of this, so we decided to rename the entire class to `KernelColorTools`.

{% hint style="info" %}
You no longer have to add the imports clause that would rename the abovementioned class. The clause that is to be removed looks like this:

```csharp
using ColorTools = KS.ConsoleBase.Colors.ColorTools
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
All calls to the kernel's `ColorTools` will now have to be called through the `KernelColorTools` class. Example below:

<pre class="language-csharp" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-csharp">// Before
<strong>internal static readonly Dictionary&#x3C;KernelColorType, Color> SelectedColors = ColorTools.PopulateColorsCurrent();
</strong>                                                                             XXXXXXXXXX
// After
<strong>internal static readonly Dictionary&#x3C;KernelColorType, Color> SelectedColors = KernelColorTools.PopulateColorsCurrent();
</strong>                                                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
{% endhint %}

### Namespace movements

```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Execution
namespace KS.Misc.Threading
namespace KS.Misc.Writers
namespace KS.Scripting
namespace KS.Hardware
```

To better organize these namespaces, we decided to move them to more appropriate places outlined below:

```csharp
namespace KS.Shell.ShellBase.Commands.Execution
namespace KS.Kernel.Threading
namespace KS.ConsoleBase.Writers
namespace KS.Shell.ShellBase.Scripting
namespace KS.Kernel.Hardware
```

First, the `Execution` namespace had to do with executing processes, which was only being done by the shell and by the TMUX pane size detector. While it was referenced outside any shell code, we feel that it would be more appropriate to move it to the shell code.

Second, the kernel threading functionality got so mature that it was moved to the kernel code, showing that it really had great importance.

Third, all of the writers had to do with the console upon analyzing the namespace. As a result, we had to move them to the `ConsoleBase` namespace so that it reflects the purpose more appropriately namespace-wise.

As for the scripting, the only code which was calling it was the UESH shell command parser, which was part of the shell. For this reason, we decided to move the namespace to better show that it was part of the shell code.

FInally, for the hardware code, it went straight to the kernel namespace as it felt that it's really a part of the kernel. The hardware code gets called each time the kernel starts and as the `hwinfo` command gets executed.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll have to adjust the namespaces as indicated in the second code block that shows the new namespaces for your mod to continue working.
{% endhint %}

### Moved JSON beautifier and minifier functions to `JsonTools`

{% code title="JsonBeautifier.cs and JsonMinifier.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static string BeautifyJson(string JsonFile)
public static string BeautifyJsonText(string JsonText)
public static string MinifyJson(string JsonFile)
public static string MinifyJsonText(string JsonText)
```
{% endcode %}

These functions used to exist in their own namespace with their own classes that are categorized based on the JSON formatting type on serialization. However, `JsonTools` looked like that it'd be the better place for them, so we've moved them into said class.

{% hint style="info" %}
To continue using these functions, you'll now have to change the using clause to point to the `KS.Misc.Editors.JsonShell` namespace and the class to `JsonTools`.
{% endhint %}

### Moved path lookup properties

{% code title="ShellManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public readonly static string PathLookupDelimiter
public static string PathsToLookup
```
{% endcode %}

These path lookup properties used to exist in the shell management code, which indicated that these variables were exclusive for the shell command parser. However, at the same time, `PathLookupTools` existed, and we thought that it would be more appropriate to move these into that class, so we decided to move them into said class.

{% hint style="info" %}
`PathLookupDelimiter` has become a property, because it was included in the public API.

If you want to continue using these variables, we suggest you to change the class in all your references to them from `ShellManager` to `PathLookupTools`.
{% endhint %}

### Removed the field manager

{% code title="FieldManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class FieldManager
```
{% endcode %}

When this was implemented, we relied on it for kernel configuration to get the variable values by name from the kernel configuration declaration file (known as SettingsEntries.json and its ancestors for screensaver and splash settings).

However, following several configuration system improvements that occurred two times:

* We've started working on the Reflection-based configuration reader and writer back at very early development stages by the following commits (in chronological order):
  * [a70787e](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/a70787eafd44c32e7ab6ad7814c587dc03d62dc9): Implemented new config reader (experimental)
  * [9d350f4](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/9d350f4b15be6bb2f01d346785800bd949e098ff): Added new config writer
  * [7d134f8](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/7d134f853a516defb9c494c56f2c9f0f88bd8175): Finalized the new config writer
  * [94d1789](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/94d1789f05f76589d9d7eedd7b344ef67c6f12b8): Removed the old config reader/writer
  * [ec3623f](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/ec3623f332e74a67581c204d4791624af17aff86): Used expressions to try to speed up config read/write
* We've removed the Reflection-based configuration as it was deemed to be very slow, and replaced its implementation with the serialization-based approach. The first commit has extensive information about the two config system merges. The following commits were done in the chronological order:
  * [f6c1386](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/f6c1386c0a93c946882ed989f8ac04436b18aab6): Merging to serialization-based config
  * [5f15a29](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/5f15a29f602d2ac0c07087228c4a502e6f4d389f): Finalized Settings for serialization-based config (pt.1)
  * [e76cca2](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/e76cca2ce18b5a79c9abf6553386e605039c7e69): Finalized Settings for serialization-based config (pt.2)

With regards to the last breaking change, which was done by commit [b96a724](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/commit/b96a7240156fb24993680f28a189b515a5fdb04d), the last "delimiter string variable" was changed from it being a field to it being a property, causing us to remove the entire field manager from the `Reflection` namespace.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this class and its functions, especially since it's useless for public fields that will either get converted to properties or get removed (if any).
{% endhint %}

## From 0.1.0 Beta 2

### Migrated to `ProvidedArgumentsInfo`

```csharp
public class ProvidedCommandArgumentsInfo
public class ProvidedArgumentArgumentsInfo
```

The first class provided information about the command arguments. It held information about user input, and it indicated whether the user input was correct or not. It worked on the UESH shell and its sub-shells either implemented by ourselves or by a custom mod. The second class, `ProvidedArgumentArgumentsInfo`, did exactly the same thing, but with one difference: it worked with kernel arguments.

However, this was considered code repetition as 95% of the parts were repeated with differences in names, so we decided to refactor these two classes to a single `ProvidedArgumentsInfo` with the following public functions found in `ArgumentsParser`:

* `ParseShellCommandArguments()`
* `ParseArgumentArguments()`

{% hint style="info" %}
We advice you to replace all calls to `Provided*ArgumentsInfo` constructors and start using the `Parse*Arguments()` function found in `ArgumentsParser`, which does the very job of parsing commands and kernel arguments.
{% endhint %}

### Migrated TUI apps' colors to `TuiColors`

We used to provide users options to change each built-in TUI application's colors, like the file manager, the contacts manager, and the task manager. Sadly, we had to migrate all these configuration entries to a single configurable TUI color class, `TuiColors`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, there is no plan that proposes restoring this.
{% endhint %}

### Moved `KernelErrorLevel` to `Kernel.Exceptions`

```csharp
public enum KernelErrorLevel
```

`KernelErrorLevel` was used by the kernel panic module, a group of functions that get executed when there was a kernel error, depending on the severity of the error and the state of the kernel.

Looking at the structure, we saw that it was left alone in the process of migrating all kernel error-related to the Kernel.Exceptions namespace, so we decided to finish the merge process by relocating `KernelErrorLevel` to `Kernel.Exceptions`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although the KernelErrorLevel enumeration is public, the kernel error functions are internal, so we may remove visibility from the public API at some point during the Beta 3 development.
{% endhint %}

### Aliases and usability problems

```csharp
public static bool AddAlias(string SourceAlias, string Destination, string Type)
public static bool AddAlias(string SourceAlias, string Destination, ShellType Type)
```

Aliases were first implemented as hard-coded aliases back on 0.0.1, but it got evolved into user-configurable aliases and went well with no problems.

However, what we haven't noticed during the custom shell type implementation is that the `ShellType` version of `AddAlias()` tends to repeat itself, causing the stack to overflow and Nitrocid KS to crash on every function that called it. This affected all the versions that implemented the custom shell types; all the way to 0.1.0 Beta 2.

However, we've noticed that the alias creation logic treats the source (a command that will be aliased to) as a target, and the target (an alias name) as a source, so we've decided to make some breaking changes to correct this confusion.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We can't document these APIs as a result of this confusion until we rewrite them with care. This re-write will reduce confusion between the source and the target, and ensure that aliases are added properly and that the tests are reporting success.
{% endhint %}

### Screensaver probing changed

```csharp
public class CustomSaverInfo
public static class CustomSaverParser
public static void InitializeCustomSaverSettings()
public static void SaveCustomSaverSettings()
public static void AddCustomSaverToSettings()
public static void RemoveCustomSaverFromSettings()
public static object GetCustomSaverSettings()
public static bool SetCustomSaverSettings()
Dictionary<string, object> ScreensaverSettings { get; set; }
```

Screensavers used to be found in their own path, called `KSScreensavers`, usually found in your user's local app data folder. However, this was implemented at a time that mods were still one-line C# and Visual Basic code files and didn't support dependencies.

When we started improving the mod parsing code, we've made these improvements starting from a version that implemented kernel modding until now, and these improvements were still getting committed.

This caused us to ditch the following features:

* Custom screensaver settings, as they have never been tested with the latest version of Nitrocid. The only time that we've tested this feature was when we were implementing this feature, and that was a long time ago.
* Custom screensaver parser that worked exactly like mod parsing code was removed and replaced with the register and unregister logics, since they were better in various degrees. This was done as a result of recent improvements to the modding system.
* `CustomSaverInfo` was removed, as none of its properties, except the base screensaver, looked like it had any use anywhere in the entire screensaver management and kernel mod management functions.
* `ReloadSaver` was removed from the list of available commands as a result of this breaking change. You can now use the kernel mod manager to load an updated version of any mod, which may register screensavers on boot.
* Paths to custom screensaver and its settings were removed from the available kernel path list as a result of all the above removals.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to be able to use a screensaver provided by your mods, they must now call the following functions from `CustomSaverTools`:

* When the mod starts up (`StartMod()`), they must call the `RegisterCustomScreensaver()` function, pointing it to your new instance of your base screensaver class.
* When the mod shuts down (`StopMod()`), they must call the `UnregisterCustomScreensaver()` function, pointing it to the name of the screensaver that you want to unregister.

You can check to see if your screensaver is initialized by calling the `IsScreensaverRegistered()` function.
{% endhint %}

### Screensaver management class renamed

{% code title="Screensaver.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class Screensaver
```
{% endcode %}

When we first implemented the screensavers, we used to call the class that was responsible for the management of the screensavers, `Screensaver`. However, it was done when Visual Basic was the dominant language for the whole simulator.

As a result of merging to C# on Milestone 2 of 0.1.0, we've decided to make final migration changes by renaming the screensaver management class to `ScreensaverManager`.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend that you change all references to `ScreensaverManager` when migrating from 0.1.0 Beta 2 or lower.
{% endhint %}

### SSH class renamed

{% code title="SSH.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class SSH
```
{% endcode %}

When we first implemented the SSH shell, we used to call the class that was responsible for launching the SSH shell, `SSH`. However, it was done when Visual Basic was the dominant language for the whole simulator.

As a result of merging to C# on Milestone 2 of 0.1.0, we've decided to make final migration changes by renaming this class to `SSHTools`.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend that you change all references to `SSHTools` when migrating from 0.1.0 Beta 2 or lower.
{% endhint %}

### Speed Dials and Network Connections

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
// FTPTools.cs and SFTPTools.cs
public static void QuickConnect()
public static void SFTPQuickConnect()

// SpeedDialTools.cs
public static void AddEntryToSpeedDial(string Address, int Port, SpeedDialType SpeedDialType, bool ThrowException = true, params object[] arguments)
public static bool TryAddEntryToSpeedDial(string Address, int Port, SpeedDialType SpeedDialType, bool ThrowException = true, params object[] arguments)

// SpeedDialType.cs
public enum SpeedDialType
```
{% endcode %}

When network connections were introduced in Beta 2, we didn't have an opportunity to make speed dials interact properly with network connections.

After Beta 2 was released, we finally took action to remove `SpeedDialType` so that `NetworkConnectionType` can be used instead. As a result, `QuickConnect()` functions in the FTP and SFTP tools code were gone and `AddEntryToSpeedDial()` and its `Try` function had its speed dial type argument replaced with `NetworkConnectionType`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Replace all calls to `SpeedDialType` with `NetworkConnectionType`. For custom network connection types, you can use new overloads of the two `Add` functions, which take a string representation of your custom network connection type.
{% endhint %}

### Handling multiple `CommandArgumentInfo` instances

```csharp
// For arguments
public ArgumentInfo(string Argument, string HelpDefinition, CommandArgumentInfo ArgArgumentInfo, ArgumentExecutor ArgumentBase, bool Obsolete = false, Action AdditionalHelpAction = null)

// For commands
public CommandInfo(string Command, ShellType Type, string HelpDefinition, CommandArgumentInfo CommandArgumentInfo, BaseCommand CommandBase, CommandFlags Flags = CommandFlags.None)
public CommandInfo(string Command, string Type, string HelpDefinition, CommandArgumentInfo CommandArgumentInfo, BaseCommand CommandBase, CommandFlags Flags = CommandFlags.None)
```

To add support for multiple `CommandArgumentInfo` instances in one `CommandInfo` or `ArgumentInfo`, we now had to replace all single `CommandArgumentInfo` parameters in the above constructors with an array argument of the same class.

This resulted in us having to adjust the entire shell system to adapt to this kind of change.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your mods must now follow the new pattern of how to define new `CommandInfo` instances in the `Commands` property in your shell class, provided that you've committed the below changes. The page below explains in depth about how to define these instances.

[shell-structure](../../advanced-and-power-users/inner-workings/shell-structure/ "mention")

The following parameters were changed:

* `CommandInfo`
  * Before: `CommandArgumentInfo CommandArgumentInfo`
  * After: `CommandArgumentInfo[] CommandArgumentInfo`
* `ArgumentInfo`
  * Before: `CommandArgumentInfo ArgArgumentInfo`
  * After: `CommandArgumentInfo[] ArgArgumentInfo`
{% endhint %}

### Screensaver displayer class is no longer public

{% code title="ScreensaverDisplayer.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class ScreensaverDisplayer
public static void DisplayScreensaver(BaseScreensaver Screensaver)
```
{% endcode %}

ScreensaverDisplayer was created as a way to show screensavers efficiently when called with `ShowSavers()`. Upon further inspection, `DisplayScreensaver()` behaves exactly the same as the `ShowSavers()` function, but with more relaxed flagging and checking.

This function was used as a thread handler, but it looks like that it can be called from any mod, so we decided to demote the class and the method shown above so that mods can't use them.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It's recommended to cease using the above class and start using `ShowSavers()` as the only suitable alternative.
{% endhint %}

### Error codes and `-set` unified switch

{% code title="BaseCommand.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public virtual void Execute(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string[] ListSwitchesOnly)
```
{% endcode %}

Initially, on Beta 2, it had a very basic error code support that set a UESH variable called `UESHErrorCode`. It didn't support errors which came from the commands itself; only from the command processor, `GetLine()`.

However, we decided to implement the following features:

* Improved error codes: UESH scripts can now rely on error codes more reliably, because error codes can now be get straight from the base command implementation, `Execute()` to be specific.
* \-set unified switch: For commands that set their output to a specific UESH variable, this switch will set that variable to the generated output, provided that the command already sets the output value, which is `ref string variableValue`.

As a result, this massive breaking change had to be done in order to implement the two abovementioned features.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that there are no built-in commands which make use of the second feature, but your mods could implement them in their own commands.

Your mods and its commands, however, will have to adapt to the first feature by changing the signature shown at the top of this section to the below signature:

```csharp
public virtual int Execute(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, ref string variableValue)
```
{% endhint %}

### Moved notification priority and type enumerations

{% code title="NotificationManager.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public enum NotifPriority
public enum NotifType
```
{% endcode %}

We've moved the two above enumerations, `NotifPriority` and `NotifType`, and renamed them to their extended names in their own code files. This is to make referencing both of them easier when creating notification instances and managing them.

{% hint style="info" %}
You no longer have to reference NotificationManager before one of the two above enumerations. However, you'll have to retry referencing them under the new names:

* `NotifPriority` -> `NotificationPriority`
* `NotifType` -> `NotificationType`
{% endhint %}

### Commands that don't accept `-set`

{% code title="CommandArgumentInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] Arguments, SwitchInfo[] Switches, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
```
{% endcode %}

We've implemented `-set` as a unified switch to set the variable to the value of the command output generated by the command class. However, there are commands that don't use this feature, hence we no longer accept their usage of `-set` unless absolutely necessary.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to take the following cases into account:

* If your command doesn't use the custom completion and your command doesn't use the `-set` switch, there is no action to be taken.
* If your command doesn't use the custom completion, but your command uses the `-set` switch, you must set the `AcceptsSet` parameter to `true`.
* If your command uses the custom completion, you may specify whether the command accepts or declines the `-set` switch, but you must enter this value before the command completion argument. The signature will help illustrate this:

```csharp
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] Arguments, SwitchInfo[] Switches, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, bool AcceptsSet = false, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
```
{% endhint %}

### Used SemanVer on `KernelUpdate`

{% code title="KernelUpdate.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public Version UpdateVersion { get; private set; }
```
{% endcode %}

As SemanVer was released to the public, we decided to release a new version of SemanVer handling SemVer 2.0-compliant versions that also follow the four-part versioning so that Nitrocid KS can accurately check for updates.

As a result, we no longer have to deal with conflicts, like debates about 0.1.0 Beta 1 being the "final" version for 0.0.24.x or lower, which is going to take effect on these series' Backport Fridays.

{% hint style="info" %}
We advice you to adjust your usage of `UpdateVersion` so that it is suitable with the `SemVer` class.
{% endhint %}

### Removed `KernelUpdateInfo`

{% code title="KernelUpdateInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public class KernelUpdateInfo
```
{% endcode %}

The kernel updater used to host two classes:

* `KernelUpdate` to fetch the updates and install relevant information to the class, like the version and the update link, and
* `KernelUpdateInfo` to host these two again.

However, `KernelUpdateInfo` was proving its redundancy regarding its functionality, so we've removed it.

{% hint style="info" %}
We advice you to use `KernelUpdate` instead of `KernelUpdateInfo`.
{% endhint %}

### Added `FileSystemEntry`

{% code title="BaseFilesystemDriver.cs (implements IFilesystemDriver)" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public virtual List<FileSystemInfo> CreateList(string folder, bool Sorted = false, bool Recursive = false)
public virtual void PrintDirectoryInfo(FileSystemInfo DirectoryInfo)
public virtual void PrintDirectoryInfo(FileSystemInfo DirectoryInfo, bool ShowDirectoryDetails)
public virtual void PrintFileInfo(FileSystemInfo FileInfo)
public virtual void PrintFileInfo(FileSystemInfo FileInfo, bool ShowFileDetails)
public virtual string SortSelector(FileSystemInfo FileSystemEntry, int MaxLength)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Listing.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static List<FileSystemInfo> CreateList(string folder, bool Sorted = false, bool Recursive = false)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="DirectoryInfoPrinter.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void PrintDirectoryInfo(FileSystemInfo DirectoryInfo)
public static void PrintDirectoryInfo(FileSystemInfo DirectoryInfo, bool ShowDirectoryDetails)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="FileInfoPrinter.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void PrintFileInfo(FileSystemInfo FileInfo)
public static void PrintFileInfo(FileSystemInfo FileInfo, bool ShowFileDetails)
```
{% endcode %}

We used to rely on `FileSystemInfo` to get basic information about any file or folder. However, we needed to extend this class to include more functions to it, so we've implemented `FileSystemEntry`.

As a result, we've replaced every `FileSystemInfo` instances with FileSystemEntry. You can still access this instance through the `BaseEntry` property.

{% hint style="info" %}
We suggest that you change how you call the above functions so that you can use an instance of `FileSystemEntry`. You can create an instance of it using the constructor.
{% endhint %}

### New way of getting a list of themes

{% code title="ThemeTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public readonly static Dictionary<string, ThemeInfo> Themes = new()
```
{% endcode %}

We used to resort to using the above field to get a list of available themes and getting an instance of the selected theme. However, the current approach was reachable to all the kernel mods and can be manipulated with.

Also, we didn't want to add a single theme to three different places, so we decided to just let the kernel populate the themes itself by splitting one massive resources file into three different resource files:

* LanguagesResources
* SettingsResources
* ThemesResources

We then make the above field private, but you can get a copy of it using the `GetInstalledThemes()` function. We've also changed the resource name of the default theme from `_Default` to `Default` as we're no longer in the Visual Basic land.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get a list of themes using this function, which has the below signature:

```csharp
public static Dictionary<string, ThemeInfo> GetInstalledThemes()
```
{% endhint %}

### Added themes support for interactive TUI colors

{% code title="InteractiveTuiColors.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class InteractiveTuiColors
```
{% endcode %}

When migration of interactive TUI colors was done, the end result was that `InteractiveTuiColors` was made to store all the interactive TUI colors for each element, like the pane background color, selected pane box border color, and so on.

However, we needed to reduce the number of reboots to set these colors, so we decided to remove this class, add these colors to the kernel color type enumeration, and update all themes to use this new feature.

This caused the interactive TUI to maintain color consistency with the rest of the Nitrocid colors.

{% hint style="info" %}
You usually don't have to do anything. You can still access these base colors using the `Config.MainConfig` class. No names are changed.
{% endhint %}

### Added connection options from speed dial

{% code title="NetworkConnectionTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void OpenConnectionForShell(ShellType shellType, Func<string, NetworkConnection> establisher, string address = "")
public static void OpenConnectionForShell(string shellType, Func<string, NetworkConnection> establisher, string address = "")
```
{% endcode %}

The network connections didn't support speed dial options, so we decided to add support for it. As a consequence, we've had to change its signature so that it would hold both the normal connection establisher and the speed-dial-based connection establisher.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must adjust your calls to the two above functions so that they also hold the speed-dial-based connection establisher, as indicated in the signatures below:

```csharp
public static void OpenConnectionForShell(ShellType shellType, Func<string, NetworkConnection> establisher, Func<string, JToken, NetworkConnection> speedEstablisher, string address = "")
public static void OpenConnectionForShell(string shellType, Func<string, NetworkConnection> establisher, Func<string, JToken, NetworkConnection> speedEstablisher, string address = "")
```
{% endhint %}

### Changed how event handler registration works

{% code title="IMod.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
void InitEvents(EventType Event);
void InitEvents(EventType Event, params object[] Args);
```
{% endcode %}

InitEvents can be huge because there are too many event types to handle, so we decided to go the easier and the cleaner way and switch the handler from `InitEvents()` to the delegate-based handler.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend merging away from `InitEvents()` to use both of the register and unregister functions that are outlined below.

```csharp
public static void RegisterEventHandler(EventType eventType, Action<object[]> eventAction)
public static void UnregisterEventHandler(EventType eventType, Action<object[]> eventAction)
```

Although your mod can contain the `InitEvents()` code because Nitrocid doesn't error out, we still advice you to follow the recommendation for your event handler code to continue working, as well as storing a list of event handlers (at least a `List<Action<object[]>>`) to be able to register and unregister them.
{% endhint %}

### Removed "background trigger"

{% code title="KernelColorTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void LoadBack(Color ColorSequence, bool Force = false)
public static void SetConsoleColor(KernelColorType colorType, bool Background, bool ForceSet = false)
public static void SetConsoleColor(Color ColorSequence, bool Background = false, bool ForceSet = false)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Flags.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static bool SetBackground =>
    Config.MainConfig.SetBackground;
```
{% endcode %}

This feature was implemented in the early stages of development for the API 3.0 kernel series. However, this wasn't tested for a long time ever since Milestone X was out, so we decided to remove this configuration.

As a result, we've removed the `Force` and the `ForceSet` variables.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this function.
{% endhint %}

### Custom command addition changed

{% code title="IMod.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
Dictionary<string, CommandInfo> Commands { get; set; }
```
{% endcode %}

Nitrocid used to use the `Commands` dictionary to register all of the commands during the mod startup. However, this was found to be unnecessary because `StartMod()` was also an entry point code for each mod. Also, this breaking change was made with respect to the recent UESH shell improvements regarding the command handling logic.

So, we decided to remove this key from the interface, making it redundant for general purposes. However, you may choose to keep the `Commands` list, given that you're going to use the command registration functions added with this change and that the commands in the `CommandInfo` instances are the same as the command dictionary keys.

Historically, the `Commands` list was originated when there was no meaningful way to customize the shell and when the command handler was not using the base command classes for each of them.

The below link shows how to use the register/unregister functions.

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-and-power-users/inner-workings/shell-structure/" %}
[shell-structure](../../advanced-and-power-users/inner-workings/shell-structure/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Mods that expect commands to be added automatically must now use the `RegisterCustomCommand*` functions on mod start and `UnregisterCustomCommand*` functions on mod shutdown. This allows you to dynamically add commands to the shells without affecting the base shell command list.

However, if you want a simple migration way, don't remove the `Commands` dictionary as it's unused; just use it to get its keys (strings) and values (`CommandInfo` instances) to use `UnregisterCustomCommands()` and `RegisterCustomCommands()` in the shutdown (`StopMod()`) and the startup code (`StartMod()`), respectively.
{% endhint %}

### Added theme addons

{% code title="ThemeInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public ThemeInfo(string ThemeResourceName)
```
{% endcode %}

The above `ThemeInfo` constructor was made obsolete due to all the themes migrating to the theme addons. This was done to try to reduce the overall size of the main Nitrocid binary.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend that you use the output of the `GetInstalledThemes()` function and query a theme info instance from the theme name instead.
{% endhint %}

### Improved the query API for text editor

{% code title="TextEditTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static Dictionary<int, Dictionary<int, string>> TextEdit_QueryChar(char Char)
public static Dictionary<int, string> TextEdit_QueryChar(char Char, int LineNumber)
public static Dictionary<int, Dictionary<int, string>> TextEdit_QueryWord(string Word)
public static Dictionary<int, string> TextEdit_QueryWord(string Word, int LineNumber)
public static Dictionary<int, Dictionary<int, string>> TextEdit_QueryWordRegex(string Word)
public static Dictionary<int, string> TextEdit_QueryWordRegex(string Word, int LineNumber)
```
{% endcode %}

The query API for the text editor has been simplified as a result of having simpler ways of expressing the results. This was also done, because we needed to highlight the results found using one of the query commands in the text editor.

{% hint style="info" %}
The signatures have been changed. You can refer to the API documentation for the updated information.
{% endhint %}

### Aliases reworked

{% code title="AliasInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void PurgeAliases()
public static bool DoesAliasExistLocal(string TargetAlias, ShellType Type)
public static bool DoesAliasExistLocal(string TargetAlias, string Type)
```
{% endcode %}

The aliases system was a mess since a long ago, because it was first implemented using a single CSV file containing information about aliased commands.

We realized how this was going to affect its maintainability, so we decided to refresh it by switching to a JSON-based serialization and deserialization method, eliminating the 3 above functions.

{% hint style="info" %}
With regards to `PurgeAliases()`, once any alias is removed, they're automatically purged.

With regards to `DoesAliasExistLocal()`, you can substitute calls to that function with the `DoesAliasExist()`, making changes as necessary.
{% endhint %}

### Added the signing key (a.k.a. strong name)

Nitrocid KS launched without any signing key. Originally, it was planned to come signed by us, but it didn't work. However, we used the strong naming tool to give Nitrocid KS a unique identity to avoid dependency hell.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's not necessary to strong name your mods, but we recommend you to do so using the strong naming utility (`sn.exe`) that comes with Visual Studio.

Most of the time, you don't have to do anything to your mods, since the signing key change doesn't break any API functions. If you found that your mods no longer worked, try to update to the latest version of Nitrocid, or contact the mod vendor.
{% endhint %}

### Interactive TUI is now part of `ConsoleBase`

{% code title="*InteractiveTui*.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Interactive
```
{% endcode %}

The interactive TUI started off as part of the `Misc` namespace found under `KS`. However, it became almost stable and ready for the prime time, so we decided to move it to `ConsoleBase` in preparation for the upcoming release of Terminaux, which brings performance-related improvements.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because this is a namespace move, you'll have to update the imports that point to the above namespace to point to the new namespace below:

```csharp
namespace KS.ConsoleBase.Interactive
```
{% endhint %}

### Used Figletize

{% code title="CenteredFigletTextColor.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, KernelColorType ColTypes, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, KernelColorType colorTypeForeground, KernelColorType colorTypeBackground, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, ConsoleColors Color, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, ConsoleColors ForegroundColor, ConsoleColors BackgroundColor, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, Color Color, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(int top, FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, Color ForegroundColor, Color BackgroundColor, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, KernelColorType ColTypes, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, KernelColorType colorTypeForeground, KernelColorType colorTypeBackground, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, ConsoleColors Color, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, ConsoleColors ForegroundColor, ConsoleColors BackgroundColor, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, Color Color, params object[] Vars)
public static void WriteCenteredFiglet(FiggleFont FigletFont, string Text, Color ForegroundColor, Color BackgroundColor, params object[] Vars)
```
{% endcode %}

This change also applies to `FigletColor` and `FigletWhereColor`.

Figgle didn't see any recent development for a long time, so we decided to tweak it a bit in our own fork, Figletize, prior to releasing it as version 0.6.0.

We decided to take out legacy support in both Nitrocid KS and Terminaux as Figgle wasn't signed using a signing key.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must migrate from Figgle to Figletize in order to be able to use the new functions. The signatures are the same, but using the `FigletizeFont` instance instead of `FiggleFont`.

Terminaux's documentation will cover the ways of migration.
{% endhint %}

### Added `CommandArgumentPart`

```csharp
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] Arguments, SwitchInfo[] Switches)
public CommandArgumentInfo(string[] Arguments, SwitchInfo[] Switches, bool ArgumentsRequired, int MinimumArguments, bool AcceptsSet = false, Func<string, int, char[], string[]> AutoCompleter = null)
```

`CommandArgumentInfo` used to use strings and few support variables for arguments. However, there are cases where mods need more control over the argument parts, especially the auto completion part.

`CommandArgumentPart` is made for this purpose, so we've changed the above constructors in `CommandArgumentInfo` to be able to specify arguments using the brand new class.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must change all `CommandArgumentInfo` instance creation to satisfy this new format. For example, `exec`'s `CommandArgumentInfo` is defined like this:

```csharp
new CommandArgumentInfo(new[]
{
    new CommandArgumentPart(true, "process"),
    new CommandArgumentPart(false, "args")
}, Array.Empty<SwitchInfo>())
```
{% endhint %}

### Remote debug configuration handler changes

{% code title="IRemoteDebugCommand.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
void Execute(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, string Address);
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="RemoteDebugTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
// Removed
public enum DeviceProperty
public static object GetDeviceProperty(string DeviceIP, DeviceProperty DeviceProperty)
public static void SetDeviceProperty(string DeviceIP, DeviceProperty DeviceProperty, object Value)
public static bool TrySetDeviceProperty(string DeviceIP, DeviceProperty DeviceProperty, object Value)
public static void AddDeviceToJson(string DeviceIP, bool ThrowException = true)
public static bool TryAddDeviceToJson(string DeviceIP, bool ThrowException = true)
public static void RemoveDeviceFromJson(string DeviceIP)
public static bool TryRemoveDeviceFromJson(string DeviceIP)

// Modified
public static void DisconnectDbgDev(string IPAddr)
public static void AddToBlockList(string IP)
public static string[] ListDevices()
```
{% endcode %}

The remote debug device handler has undergone significant changes related to how it handles remote device configuration, because we needed a less convoluted way of obtaining device properties and setting them, so we decided to make the following changes as stated in the comments of the above snippet.

{% hint style="info" %}
As a result, custom remote debug command classes must now change the signature to match the below signature definition:

```csharp
void Execute(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, RemoteDebugDeviceInfo Address);
```
{% endhint %}

### Speed dial configuration changes

{% code title="NetworkConnectionTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void OpenConnectionForShell(ShellType shellType, Func<string, NetworkConnection> establisher, Func<string, JToken, NetworkConnection> speedEstablisher, string address = "")
public static void OpenConnectionForShell(string shellType, Func<string, NetworkConnection> establisher, Func<string, JToken, NetworkConnection> speedEstablisher, string address = "")
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="SpeedDialTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
// Removed
public static JObject GetTokenFromSpeedDial()
public static JToken GetQuickConnectInfo()

// Modified
public static Dictionary<string, JToken> ListSpeedDialEntries()
public static Dictionary<string, JToken> ListSpeedDialEntriesByType(NetworkConnectionType SpeedDialType)
public static Dictionary<string, JToken> ListSpeedDialEntriesByType(string SpeedDialType)
```
{% endcode %}

The speed dial handler has undergone significant changes related to how it handles speed dial configuration, because we needed a less convoluted way of obtaining speed dial properties and setting them, so we decided to make the following changes as stated in the comments of the above snippet.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because `SpeedDialEntry` is implemented, you need to use the new overloads and functions from the SpeedDialTools class when migrating from the old `JToken` approach.
{% endhint %}

### Breaking changes caused by migration to addons

There are breaking changes that are caused by the migration of some of the optional kernel features to the addons system so that they don't bloat the base kernel up. The following applications are affected:

* To-do list
* Forecast
* Contacts
* Calendar
* Archive Shell
* Games and Amusements
* Timers
* Dictionary
* Name generation
* Unit conversion
* Lyrics
* Calculators
* Theme and Language studios
* Color conversion commands

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your mods will no longer be able to use their APIs, due to how these addons are isolated from the base kernel.
{% endhint %}

### Removed Figgle-related tools and writers

{% code title="Deleted classes" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class CenteredFigletTextColorLegacy
public static class FigletColorLegacy
public static class FigletWhereColorLegacy
```
{% endcode %}

Because Terminaux got updated in a way that it separated Figgle-related tools and writers from the Figletize-based implementation, we've decided to remove all Figgle-related tools and writers from the Nitrocid KS codebase.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must migrate from Figgle to Figletize in order to be able to use the new functions. The signatures are the same, but using the `FigletizeFont` instance instead of `FiggleFont`.

Terminaux's documentation will cover the ways of migration.
{% endhint %}

### Moved `ShellManager` to `ShellBase.Shells`

```csharp
public static class ShellManager
```

`ShellManager` used to be found on a loose `KS.Shell` namespace. However, we needed to enforce better organization of the shell management code, so we moved this class to the `ShellBase.Shells` namespace inside `KS.Shell`.

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the functions are affected by this change. However, you need to change the imports to point to the `ShellBase.Shells` namespace.
{% endhint %}

### Moved `Editors` to `Files`

{% code title="Affected editors" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Editors.HexEdit
namespace KS.Misc.Editors.JsonShell
namespace KS.Misc.Editors.SqlEdit
namespace KS.Misc.Editors.TextEdit
```
{% endcode %}

The following editors have been moved from `Misc` to `Files` as a result of their APIs being mature:

* Hex editor
* JSON shell
* SQL editor
* Text editor

This is to acknowledge that these editors are indeed part of the filesystem editing process.

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the functions are affected, but you must change the namespace imports to the following:

```csharp
namespace KS.Files.Editors.HexEdit
namespace KS.Files.Editors.JsonShell
namespace KS.Files.Editors.SqlEdit
namespace KS.Files.Editors.TextEdit
```
{% endhint %}

### Updated `LocaleGen.Core` namespaces

```csharp
namespace Nitrocid.LocaleGen.Serializer
```

`LocaleGen.Core` is a library that generates final translation files for each built-in and custom language for Nitrocid KS to be able to use.

To clear up the organization, we've decided to update the above namespace to match the library name.

{% hint style="info" %}
The new namespace for the `LocaleGen.Core` functions is:

```csharp
namespace Nitrocid.LocaleGen.Core.Serializer
```
{% endhint %}

### Promoted Settings to `Kernel.Configuration`

{% code title="SettingsApp.cs, SettingsKeyType.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Settings
```
{% endcode %}

Interactive settings was initially implemented as a Windows Forms application independent of the main application. It was moved to Nitrocid starting from 0.0.12.0.

The "Settings" application was meant to be a core part of the kernel, so we've moved all the Settings classes to the `KS.Kernel.Configuration.Settings` namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the classes are affected, but you should update your namespace imports to the below namespace:

```csharp
namespace KS.Kernel.Configuration.Settings
```
{% endhint %}

### Corrected the name of `Journaling` enum entry

{% code title="KernelPathType.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public enum KernelPathType
{
    (...)
    Journalling,
    (...)
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Paths.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static string JournallingPath =>
    Filesystem.NeutralizePath(AppDataPath + "/KSJournal.json");
```
{% endcode %}

When kernel journaling was first released, it was initially implemented under the name of "Journalling," but we found out that it wasn't a correct spelling for the word.

We've decided to correct that by renaming the enumeration value and the property.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use any of the two affected objects mentioned above, change your references so that it says `Journaling`.
{% endhint %}

### Moved presentation system to `ConsoleBase`

{% code title="Affected namespaces" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Presentation
namespace KS.Misc.Presentation.Elements
```
{% endcode %}

The presentation system used to be found in the Misc section of the kernel. However, it has been moved to a completely different section as it has to do more with printing things to the console.

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the classes are affected, but you should update your namespace imports to the below namespace:

```csharp
namespace KS.ConsoleBase.Presentation
namespace KS.ConsoleBase.Presentation.Elements
```
{% endhint %}

### Renamed `Flags` to `KernelFlags`

{% code title="Flags.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Kernel
    public static class Flags
```
{% endcode %}

In order to maintain consistency for the naming scheme that we use for our base classes, we've renamed `Flags` to `KernelFlags`.

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the flags are affected. However, the following changes are made:

* Changed the class name to `KernelFlags`
* Changed the namespace to `KS.Kernel.Configuration`
{% endhint %}

### Moved argument and switch management

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
// Migrated to KS.Shell.ShellBase.Switches
public class SwitchInfo
public static class SwitchManager

// Migrated to KS.Shell.ShellBase.Commands
public static class ProcessExecutor

// Migrated to KS.Shell.ShellBase.Arguments
public static class ArgumentsParser
public class CommandArgumentInfo
public class CommandArgumentPart
public static class CommandAutoCompletionList
public class ProvidedArgumentsInfo
```
{% endcode %}

The `KS.Shell.ShellBase.Commands` namespace kept getting bigger with each new feature UESH receives from time to time, so we've decided to clear the confusion and move the above classes to their respective namespaces:

* `KS.Shell.ShellBase.Switches`
* `KS.Shell.ShellBase.Commands`
* `KS.Shell.ShellBase.Arguments`

{% hint style="info" %}
None of the functions are affected, but you must adjust the namespace imports to the above namespaces.
{% endhint %}

### `HelpDefinition`'s setter is private

{% code title="SwitchInfo.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public string HelpDefinition { get; set; }
```
{% endcode %}

When `HelpDefinition` was first implemented, its setter was open, under the assumption that mods can adjust their help definitions when they define their commands.

However, with the improved shell and its command handling code, especially the inception of `CommandArgumentInfo` and its siblings, we've decided to finally make the setter private.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can no longer use the HelpDefinition property to directly set your command description. Instead, define your command description when making your own `CommandInfo` and its associated `CommandArgumentInfo` and `SwitchInfo` instances, if any.
{% endhint %}

### Implemented original argument string and list

{% code title="BaseCommand.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public override int Execute(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, ref string variableValue)
public override int ExecuteDumb(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, ref string variableValue)
```
{% endcode %}

You only had a text of arguments and its list version, which were processed. However, we've considered cases where the unprocessed version might be more appropriate.

So, we've decided to implement the first two variables again, but, this time, the unprocessed version. That means no removal of any content in the text.

{% hint style="info" %}
The signature for these two functions has changed. You must change your override to match the new signature, like below:

```csharp
public override int Execute(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string StringArgsOrig, string[] ListArgsOnlyOrig, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, ref string variableValue)
public override int ExecuteDumb(string StringArgs, string[] ListArgsOnly, string StringArgsOrig, string[] ListArgsOnlyOrig, string[] ListSwitchesOnly, ref string variableValue)
```
{% endhint %}

### Moved parsers to the `Text` namespace

{% code title="Affected namespaces" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Probers.Motd
namespace KS.Misc.Probers.Placeholder
namespace KS.Misc.Probers.Regexp
```
{% endcode %}

These probers used to be loosely located on the `Probers` section of the `Misc` namespace. In order to improve organization, we've relocated these namespaces to the `Text` section of the `Probers` namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
These namespaces have been located to the new location. They can be respectively found on:

```csharp
namespace KS.Misc.Text.Probers.Motd
namespace KS.Misc.Text.Probers.Placeholder
namespace KS.Misc.Text.Probers.Regexp
```
{% endhint %}

### Remove leftover namespace, `UserProperty`

{% code title="UserManagement.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public enum UserProperty
```
{% endcode %}

`UserProperty` was first implemented on 0.0.16.0 as a result of converting the users configuration file to the JSON format from the old CSV format known to have flaws.

Over time, it was populated with the following properties:

* Username
* Password
* Admin
* Anonymous
* Disabled
* Permissions
* FullName
* PreferredLanguage
* Groups

However, we've made a third refinement to the login configuration logic, this time, using the JSON serialization and deserialization techniques to reduce the complexity.

As a result, `UserProperty` was rendered useless.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We advice you to cease using this enumeration. It's neccessary that you use more appropriate ways to get and set user properties to ensure that the mod code transition from Beta 2 or lower to Beta 3 goes smoothly.
{% endhint %}
