# v0.1.2.x and v0.1.3.x series

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (90).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This kernel version series gives your kernel a bit of a makeover in several aspects, especially the API that got massively changed in terms of console rendering. It is built on API v3.1, which means that mods that depend on API v3.0 or lower won't work with this version or higher. This API revision will be released on **February 27th, 2025**.
