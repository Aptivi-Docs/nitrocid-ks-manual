# ‚è´ Upgrading the Kernel

Nitrocid KS can be upgraded in all supported platforms. However, some upgrades might break your mods and configuration files, so please be sure that you follow the compatibility notes which is linked below.

Generally, Nitrocid KS can automatically download an update file and, if launched through the built-in launcher for Linux systems, installs the update itself. For Windows systems, it can be seamlessly updated if you installed Nitrocid through Chocolatey. For Ubuntu systems, Nitrocid PPA installs can also be updated through `apt upgrade`.

However, if this mechanism fails, you can rely on manually updating. Select your platform to get instructions.
