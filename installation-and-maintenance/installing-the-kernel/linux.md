## Installation

There are several ways to install Kernel Simulator on Linux systems.

### Method 1: Manual unpack

If you like to manually unpack the Kernel Simulator packages, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have all the required software installed
2. Download the latest release RAR file from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases). Files that end with the `-dotnet` prefix means that it's for .NET 6.0.
3. Unpack the RAR archive to any folder of your choice
4. Open your favorite terminal emulator, like Konsole, and change the working directory to a folder containing the Kernel Simulator executable
5. Execute `mono Kernel Simulator.exe` for .NET Framework or `dotnet Kernel Simulator.dll` for .NET 6.0 to start the kernel

### Method 2: Ubuntu PPA

If you're running Ubuntu, you can install KS using the Ubuntu PPA. Just follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal emulator and execute the following:
   * sudo add-apt-repository ppa:eofla/kernel-sim
   * sudo apt update
2. Install the `kernel-simulator` package
   * sudo apt install kernel-simulator
3. Start `ks` or use your app drawer to find `Kernel Simulator`

## Bleeding-edge

Bleeding-edge builds usually come from building the development branch of the kernel, and they usually contain bugs and other untested features.

If you're a tester to such software, please follow the steps on your Windows machine. Please be sure that you're signed in to your GitHub account.

1. Open [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/actions/workflows/build-linux.yml)
2. Select the most recent build
3. Scroll down to Artifacts and click on the `ks-build` button to download the ZIP file
4. Extract the file. Be sure that you have the latest version of 7-Zip or your favorite archive manager installed
5. Open your favorite terminal emulator, like Konsole, and change the working directory to a folder containing the Kernel Simulator executable
6. Execute `mono Kernel Simulator.exe` for .NET Framework or `dotnet Kernel Simulator.dll` for .NET 6.0 to start the kernel
